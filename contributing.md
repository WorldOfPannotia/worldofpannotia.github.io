### Typos and other fixes

A large amount of content on this site is from the D&amp;D 3.5 SRD, but that does not mean it is sure to be free of typos and other easy-to-miss mistakes. Users finding any mistakes on the site are encouraged to [post an issue](https://github.com/chimericdream/worldofpannotia.com/issues) on the GitHub issues page or (even better) [submit a pull request](https://github.com/chimericdream/worldofpannotia.com/pulls) with a fix.

### New content

Suggestions for new content (feats, monsters, equipment, etc) are always welcome. The best place to submit new ideas is the [Pannotia Trello board](https://trello.com/b/CsWgMmKn/).
