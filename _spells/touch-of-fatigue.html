  description:        |
    You channel negative energy through your touch, fatiguing the target. You must succeed on a touch attack to strike a target.

    The subject is immediately fatigued for the spell's duration.

    This spell has no effect on a creature that is already fatigued. Unlike with normal fatigue, the effect ends as soon as the spell's duration expires.
