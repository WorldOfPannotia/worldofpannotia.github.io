  description:        |
    A vivid cone of clashing colors springs forth from your hand, causing creatures to become stunned, perhaps also blinded, and possibly knocking them unconscious.

    Each creature within the cone is affected according to its Hit Dice.

    2 HD or less: The creature is unconscious, blinded, and stunned for 2d4 rounds, then blinded and stunned for 1d4 rounds, and then stunned for 1 round. (Only living creatures are knocked unconscious.)

    3 or 4 HD: The creature is blinded and stunned for 1d4 rounds, then stunned for 1 round.

    5 or more HD: The creature is stunned for 1 round.

    Sightless creatures are not affected by color spray.
