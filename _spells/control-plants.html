  description:        |
    This spell enables you to control the actions of one or more plant creatures for a short period of time. You command the creatures by voice and they understand you, no matter what language you speak. Even if vocal communication is impossible the controlled plants do not attack you. At the end of the spell, the subjects revert to their normal behavior.

    Suicidal or self-destructive commands are simply ignored.
