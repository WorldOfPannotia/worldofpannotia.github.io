  description:        |
    You can free one or more creatures from the effects of any temporary paralysis or related magic, including a ghoul's touch or a slow spell. If the spell is cast on one creature, the paralysis is negated. If cast on two creatures, each receives another save with a +4 resistance bonus against the effect that afflicts it. If cast on three or four creatures, each receives another save with a +2 resistance bonus.

    The spell does not restore ability scores reduced by penalties, damage, or drain.
