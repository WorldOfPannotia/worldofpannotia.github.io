  description:        |
    You create a destructive resonance in a corporeal creature's body. For each round you concentrate, you cause one creature to collapse in on itself, killing it. (This effect, being instantaneous, cannot be dispelled.)

    You can target a particular creature only once with each casting of the spell.

    Implosion has no effect on creatures in gaseous form or on incorporeal creatures.
