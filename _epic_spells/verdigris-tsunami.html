  description: |
    This spell creates a tsunami of grass, shrubs, and trees that overgrows the area like a tidal wave. The plant growth creeps and curls across every-thing in the area, ensnaring it and coiling around it as if it had been growing there for a century or more. Creatures in the area must make a Reflex saving throw to avoid the fast-moving growth, which otherwise deals 40d6 points of damage from the crushing press. Buildings are engulfed and they likewise take 40d6 points of damage. Those destroyed by the damage have their foundations uprooted and walls crumbled. The plant growth is permanent. This is a ritual spell requiring fourteen other spellcasters, each of whom must contribute an unused 6th-level spell slot to the casting.
