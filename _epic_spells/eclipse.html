  description: |
    With this spell, the character can create a limited eclipse, as though a heavenly body moves between the sun and the earth. The landscape within a five-mile radius of the character's location experiences the dimming of the sun as a disk the character creates passes in front of it, culminating in a complete blackout and accompanying coronal ring. The eclipse follows the character across the landscape for up to 8 hours, or until the sun goes down, or until the character dismisses the eclipse. The character does not need to concentrate on the eclipse while it lasts.
