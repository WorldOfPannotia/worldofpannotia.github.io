<h3 id="creating-a-horror-zombie">Creating A Horror Zombie</h3>

<p>"Horror Zombie" is an acquired template that can be added to any corporeal creature (other than an undead) that has a skeletal system (referred to hereafter as the base creature).</p>

<p><strong>Size and Type:</strong> The creature’s type changes to undead. It retains any subtype except for alignment subtypes (such as good) and subtypes that indicate kind. It does not gain the augmented subtype but does gain the cold subtype. It uses all the base creature’s statistics and special abilities except as noted here.</p>

<p><strong>Hit Dice:</strong> Drop any Hit Dice from class levels (to a minimum of 1), double the number of Hit Dice left, and raise them to d12s.</p>

<p><strong>Speed:</strong> The base creature’s speed for its primary mode of movement increases by 10 feet. If the base creature can fly, its maneuverability rating drops to clumsy.</p>

<p><strong>Armor Class:</strong> A Horror Zombie is considered to be proficient with whatever armor the base creature is wearing, but does not use shields, even if the base creature is described as using a shield. Natural armor bonus increases by a number based on the Horror Zombie’s size.</p>

<p><strong>Base Attack:</strong> A Horror Zombie has a base attack bonus equal to ½ its Hit Dice or its original base attack bonus, whichever is better.</p>

<p><em>Special:</em> Horror Zombies with more than 20 total Hit Dice have a maximum base attack of +10 (or their normal base attack) plus ½ their total Hit Dice over 20.</p>

<p><strong>Attacks:</strong> A Horror Zombie retains all the natural weapons of the base creature, but loses all manufactured weapon attacks and weapon proficiencies. A Horror Zombie also gains a slam attack, a bite attack, and one claw attack per hand.</p>

<p><strong>Damage:</strong> Natural deal damage normally. A slam or bite attack deals damage depending on the Horror Zombie’s size. (Use the base creature’s slam or bite damage if it’s better.)</p>

<p><strong>Special Attacks:</strong> A Horror Zombie retains none of the base creature’s special attacks.</p>

<h3 id="special-qualities">Special Qualities</h3>

<p>A Horror Zombie loses most special qualities of the base creature. It retains any extraordinary special qualities that improve its natural attacks, but loses all class features it had from class levels. A Horror Zombie gains the following special qualities.</p>

<p><strong>Cold Subtype:</strong> Horror Zombies are immune to Cold and take half again as much (+50%) damage from Fire.</p>

<p><strong>Damage Reduction (Ex):</strong> A Horror Zombie has damage reduction 10/-. Horror Zombies are lumbering masses of flesh, but damage to their head and neck usually serve to incapacitate them quickly. Critical hits are considered headshots and deal normal damage (not multiplied critical damage) to a Horror Zombie, bypassing its damage reduction.</p>

<p><strong>Scent (Ex):</strong> A Horror Zombie gains the scent special ability.</p>

<p><strong>Frenzy (Ex):</strong> Any time a Horror Zombie senses a living creature nearby (whether by seeing, hearing, or smelling the creature), it flies into a frenzy and attacks the creature. If the Horror Zombie cannot get to the creature, it will pursue any means necessary to get around whatever obstacles are in the way. The Horror Zombie does not relent in its attack until it is destroyed, or its victim is killed. While in this frenzy, a Horror Zombie gains a +4 bonus to Strength, +2 hit points per Hit Die, and a +2 morale bonus on Will saves, but it takes a -2 penalty to Armor Class. These extra hit points are not lost first the way temporary hit points are and go away at the end of the frenzy. However, if this loss of hit points would cause the Horror Zombie to drop to or below 0 hit points, it is instead left at 1 hit point at the end of the frenzy.</p>

<p><strong>Fast Healing (Ex):</strong> Each round, a Horror Zombie heals up to 10 points of damage.</p>

<p><strong>Horror Zombie’s Curse (Su):</strong> Any creature bitten by a Horror Zombie must succeed a Fortitude save vs. a DC of 12 + the Horror Zombie’s total HD (maximum DC 30). Failure on this save means the creature has contracted the Horror Zombie’s Curse, and will take 1d3 Constitution damage each day. Some creatures can live for several weeks with this curse before finally dying. When a cursed creature dies (whether from the Horror Zombie’s Curse or for other reasons), it rises 1d4 minutes later as another Horror Zombie. Only <a href="//worldofpannotia.com/game-rules/magic/spells/remove-curse/" title="Remove Curse"><em>Remove Curse</em></a>, <a href="//worldofpannotia.com/game-rules/magic/spells/limited-wish/" title="Limited Wish"><em>Limited Wish</em></a>, <a href="//worldofpannotia.com/game-rules/magic/spells/wish/" title="Wish"><em>Wish</em></a>, or <a href="//worldofpannotia.com/game-rules/magic/spells/miracle/" title="Miracle"><em>Miracle</em></a> spell will rid a creature of the Horror Zombie’s Curse.</p>

<p><strong>Turn Resistance (Su):</strong> Horror Zombies have +3 turn resistance.</p>

<p><strong>Saves:</strong> Base save bonuses are Fort +⅓ HD, Ref +½ HD +2, and Will +½ HD + 2.</p>

<p><em>Special:</em> Horror Zombies with more than 20 total Hit Dice have maximum base saves of +6/+12/+12 plus ½ their total Hit Dice over 20.</p>

<p><strong>Abilities:</strong> A Horror Zombie’s Strength increases by +4, its Dexterity increases by +4, it has no Constitution score, its Wisdom changes to 10, and its Charisma and Intelligence change to 1.</p>

<p><strong>Skills:</strong> A Horror Zombie has a +6 racial bonus on <a href="//worldofpannotia.com/game-rules/skills/#skill--climb" title="Climb"><em>Climb</em></a>, <a href="//worldofpannotia.com/game-rules/skills/#skill--jump" title="Jump"><em>Jump</em></a>, <a href="//worldofpannotia.com/game-rules/skills/#skill--listen" title="Listen"><em>Listen</em></a>, and <a href="//worldofpannotia.com/game-rules/skills/#skill--spot" title="Spot"><em>Spot</em></a>. Horror Zombies are not able to use any other skills. They receive a total number of skill points equal to their Hit Dice +3 to be allocated equally among these skills. If the Horror Zombie does not have a number of Hit Dice evenly divisible by 4, the remaining skill points will be assigned in the following order: <a href="//worldofpannotia.com/game-rules/skills/#skill--spot" title="Spot"><em>Spot</em></a>, <a href="//worldofpannotia.com/game-rules/skills/#skill--listen" title="Listen"><em>Listen</em></a>, and <a href="//worldofpannotia.com/game-rules/skills/#skill--climb" title="Climb"><em>Climb</em></a>.</p>

<p><strong>Feats:</strong> A Horror Zombie loses all feats of the base creature and gains <a href="//worldofpannotia.com/game-rules/feats/feat-index/multiattack/" title="Multiattack">Multiattack</a>, <a href="//worldofpannotia.com/game-rules/feats/feat-index/run/" title="Run">Run</a>, and <a href="//worldofpannotia.com/game-rules/feats/feat-index/toughness/" title="Toughness">Toughness</a> (×3).</p>

<p><strong>Environment:</strong> Any land and underground.</p>

<p><strong>Organization:</strong> Any.</p>

<p><strong>Challenge Rating:</strong> Depends on Hit Dice, as below.</p>
