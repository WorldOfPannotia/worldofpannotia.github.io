<div id="outsider" class="type-box">
    <h5>Outsider Type</h5>
    <p>An outsider is at least partially composed of the essence (but not necessarily the material) of some plane other than the Material Plane. Some creatures start out as some other type and become outsiders when they attain a higher (or lower) state of spiritual existence.</p>
    <p><em>Features:</em> An outsider has the following features.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>8-sided Hit Dice.</li>

    <ul>
        <li>Darkvision out to 60 feet.</li>
        <li>Unlike most other living creatures, an outsider does not have a dual nature &ndash; its soul and body form one unit. When an outsider is slain, no soul is set loose. Spells that restore souls to their bodies, such as <em>raise dead, reincarnate</em>, and <em>resurrection</em>, don't work on an outsider. It takes a different magical effect, such as <em>limited wish, wish, miracle</em>, or <em>true resurrection</em> to restore it to life. An outsider with the native subtype can be raised, reincarnated, or resurrected just as other living creatures can be.</li>
        <li>Proficient with all simple and martial weapons and any weapons mentioned in its entry.</li>
        <li>Proficient with whatever type of armor (light, medium, or heavy) it is described as wearing, as well as all lighter types. Outsiders not indicated as wearing armor are not proficient with armor. Outsiders are proficient with shields if they are proficient with any form of armor.</li>

        <li>Uses its Charisma modifier for <em>concentration</em> checks.</li>

<h4 id="subtypes">Creature Subtypes</h4>
<p id="air"><strong>Air Subtype:</strong> This subtype usually is used for elementals and outsiders with a connection to the Elemental Plane Air. Air creatures always have fly speeds and usually have perfect maneuverability.</p>

<p id="angel"><strong>Angel Subtype:</strong> Angels are a race of celestials, or good outsiders, native to the good-aligned Outer Planes.</p>
<p><em>Traits:</em> An angel possesses the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature's entry).</p>
<ul>
    <li>Darkvision out to 60 feet and low-light vision.</li>
    <li>Immunity to acid, cold, and petrification.</li>
    <li>Resistance to electricity 10 and fire 10.</li>
    <li>+4 racial bonus on saves against poison.</li>
    <li>Protective Aura (Su): Against attacks made or effects created by evil creatures, this ability provides a +4 deflection bonus to AC and a +4 resistance bonus on saving throws to anyone within 20 feet of the angel. Otherwise, it functions as a <em>magic circle against evil</em> effect and a <em>lesser globe of invulnerability</em>, both with a radius of 20 feet (caster level equals angel's HD). (The defensive benefits from the circle are not included in an angel's statistics block.)</li>
    <li>Tongues (Su): All angels can speak with any creature that has a language, as though using a <em>tongues</em> spell (caster level equal to angel's Hit Dice). This ability is always active.</li>
</ul>

<p id="aquatic"><strong>Aquatic Subtype:</strong> These creatures always have swim speeds and thus can move in water without making <em>swim</em> checks. An aquatic creature can breathe underwater. It cannot also breathe air unless it has the amphibious special quality.</p>

<p id="archon"><strong>Archon Subtype:</strong> Archons are a race of celestials, or good outsiders, native to lawful good-aligned Outer Planes.</p>
<p><em>Traits:</em> An archon possesses the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature's entry).</p>
<ul>
    <li>Darkvision out to 60 feet and low-light vision.</li>
    <li>Aura of Menace (Su): A righteous aura surrounds archons that fight or get angry. Any hostile creature within a 20-foot radius of an archon must succeed on a Will save to resist its effects. The save DC varies with the type of archon, is Charisma-based, and includes a +2 racial bonus. Those who fail take a -2 penalty on attacks, AC, and saves for 24 hours or until they successfully hit the archon that generated the aura. A creature that has resisted or broken the effect cannot be affected again by the same archon's aura for 24 hours.</li>
    <li>Immunity to electricity and petrification.</li>
    <li>+4 racial bonus on saves against poison.</li>
    <li>Magic Circle against Evil (Su): A magic circle against evil effect always surrounds an archon (caster level equals the archon's Hit Dice). (The defensive benefits from the circle are not included in an archon's statistics block.)</li>
    <li>Teleport (Su): Archons can use greater teleport at will, as the spell (caster level 14th), except that the creature can transport only itself and up to 50 pounds of objects.</li>
    <li>Tongues (Su): All archons can speak with any creature that has a language, as though using a <em>tongues</em> spell (caster level 14th). This ability is always active.</li>
</ul>

<p id="augmented"><strong>Augmented Subtype:</strong> A creature receives this subtype whenever something happens to change its original type. Some creatures (those with an inherited template) are born with this subtype; others acquire it when they take on an acquired template. The augmented subtype is always paired with the creature's original type. A creature with the augmented subtype usually has the traits of its current type, but the features of its original type.</p>

<p id="chaotic"><strong>Chaotic Subtype:</strong> A subtype usually applied only to outsiders native to the chaotic-aligned Outer Planes. Most creatures that have this subtype also have chaotic alignments; however, if their alignments change they still retain the subtype. Any effect that depends on alignment affects a creature with this subtype as if the creature has a chaotic alignment, no matter what its alignment actually is. The creature also suffers effects according to its actual alignment. A creature with the chaotic subtype overcomes damage reduction as if its natural weapons and any weapons it wields were chaotic-aligned (see Damage Reduction, below).</p>

<p id="cold"><strong>Cold Subtype:</strong> A creature with the cold subtype has immunity to cold. It has vulnerability to fire, which means it takes half again as much (+50%) damage as normal from fire, regardless of whether a saving throw is allowed, or if the save is a success or failure.</p>

<p id="earth"><strong>Earth Subtype:</strong> This subtype usually is used for elementals and outsiders with a connection to the Elemental Plane of Earth. Earth creatures usually have burrow speeds, and most earth creatures can burrow through solid rock.</p>

<p id="evil"><strong>Evil Subtype:</strong> A subtype usually applied only to outsiders native to the evil-aligned Outer Planes. Evil outsiders are also called fiends. Most creatures that have this subtype also have evil alignments; however, if their alignments change, they still retain the subtype. Any effect that depends on alignment affects a creature with this subtype as if the creature has an evil alignment, no matter what its alignment actually is. The creature also suffers effects according to its actual alignment. A creature with the evil subtype overcomes damage reduction as if its natural weapons and any weapons it wields were evil-aligned (see Damage Reduction, above).</p>

<p id="extraplanar"><strong>Extraplanar Subtype:</strong> A subtype applied to any creature when it is on a plane other than its native plane. A creature that travels the planes can gain or lose this subtype as it goes from plane to plane. Monster entries assume that encounters with creatures take place on the Material Plane, and every creature whose native plane is not the Material Plane has the extraplanar subtype (but would not have when on its home plane). Every extraplanar creature in this book has a home plane mentioned in its description. Creatures not labeled as extraplanar are natives of the Material Plane, and they gain the extraplanar subtype if they leave the Material Plane. No creature has the extraplanar subtype when it is on a transitive plane, such as the Astral Plane, the Ethereal Plane, and the Plane of Shadow.</p>

<p id="fire"><strong>Fire Subtype:</strong> A creature with the fire subtype has immunity to fire. It has vulnerability to cold, which means it takes half again as much (+50%) damage as normal from cold, regardless of whether a saving throw is allowed, or if the save is a success or failure.</p>

<p id="goblinoid"><strong>Goblinoid Subtype:</strong> Goblinoids are stealthy humanoids who live by hunting and raiding and who all speak Goblin.</p>

<p id="good"><strong>Good Subtype:</strong> A subtype usually applied only to outsiders native to the good-aligned Outer Planes. Most creatures that have this subtype also have good alignments; however, if their alignments change, they still retain the subtype. Any effect that depends on alignment affects a creature with this subtype as if the creature has a good alignment, no matter what its alignment actually is. The creature also suffers effects according to its actual alignment. A creature with the good subtype overcomes damage reduction as if its natural weapons and any weapons it wields were good-aligned (see Damage Reduction, above).</p>

<p id="incorporeal"><strong>Incorporeal Subtype:</strong> An incorporeal creature has no physical body. It can be harmed only by other incorporeal creatures, magic weapons or creatures that strike as magic weapons, and spells, spell-like abilities, or supernatural abilities. It is immune to all nonmagical attack forms. Even when hit by spells or magic weapons, it has a 50% chance to ignore any damage from a corporeal source (except for positive energy, negative energy, force effects such as <em>magic missile</em>, or attacks made with <em>ghost touch</em> weapons). Although it is not a magical attack, holy water can affect incorporeal undead, but a hit with holy water has a 50% chance of not affecting an incorporeal creature.</p>
<p>An incorporeal creature has no natural armor bonus but has a deflection bonus equal to its Charisma bonus (always at least +1, even if the creature's Charisma score does not normally provide a bonus).</p>
<p>An incorporeal creature can enter or pass through solid objects, but must remain adjacent to the object's exterior, and so cannot pass entirely through an object whose space is larger than its own. It can sense the presence of creatures or objects within a square adjacent to its current location, but enemies have total concealment (50% miss chance) from an incorporeal creature that is inside an object. In order to see farther from the object it is in and attack normally, the incorporeal creature must emerge. An incorporeal creature inside an object has total cover, but when it attacks a creature outside the object it only has cover, so a creature outside with a readied action could strike at it as it attacks. An incorporeal creature cannot pass through a force effect.</p>
<p>An incorporeal creature's attacks pass through (ignore) natural armor, armor, and shields, although deflection bonuses and force effects (such as <em>mage armor</em>) work normally against it. Incorporeal creatures pass through and operate in water as easily as they do in air. Incorporeal creatures cannot fall or take falling damage. Incorporeal creatures cannot make trip or grapple attacks, nor can they be tripped or grappled. In fact, they cannot take any physical action that would move or manipulate an opponent or its equipment, nor are they subject to such actions. Incorporeal creatures have no weight and do not set off traps that are triggered by weight.</p>
<p>An incorporeal creature moves silently and cannot be heard with <em>listen</em> checks if it doesn't wish to be. It has no Strength score, so its Dexterity modifier applies to both its melee attacks and its ranged attacks. Nonvisual senses, such as scent and blindsight, are either ineffective or only partly effective with regard to incorporeal creatures. Incorporeal creatures have an innate sense of direction and can move at full speed even when they cannot see.</p>

<p id="lawful"><strong>Lawful:</strong> A subtype usually applied only to outsiders native to the lawful-aligned Outer Planes. Most creatures that have this subtype also have lawful alignments; however, if their alignments change, they still retain the subtype. Any effect that depends on alignment affects a creature with this subtype as if the creature has a lawful alignment, no matter what its alignment actually is. The creature also suffers effects according to its actual alignment. A creature with the lawful subtype overcomes damage reduction as if its natural weapons and any weapons it wields were lawful-aligned (see Damage Reduction, above).</p>

<p id="native"><strong>Native Subtype:</strong> A subtype applied only to outsiders. These creatures have mortal ancestors or a strong connection to the Material Plane and can be raised, reincarnated, or resurrected just as other living creatures can be. Creatures with this subtype are native to the Material Plane (hence the subtype's name). Unlike true outsiders, native outsiders need to eat and sleep.</p>

<p id="reptillian"><strong>Reptilian Subtype:</strong> These creatures are scaly and usually coldblooded. The reptilian subtype is only used to describe a set of humanoid races, not all animals and monsters that are truly reptiles.</p>

<p id="shapechanger"><strong>Shapechanger Subtype:</strong> A shapechanger has the supernatural ability to assume one or more alternate forms. Many magical effects allow some kind of shape shifting, and not every creature that can change shapes has the shapechanger subtype.</p>
<p><em>Traits:</em> A shapechanger possesses the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature's entry).</p>
<ul>
    <li>Proficient with its natural weapons, with simple weapons, and with any weapons mentioned in the creature's description.</li>
    <li>Proficient with any armor mentioned in the creature's description, as well as all lighter forms. If no form of armor is mentioned, the shapechanger is not proficient with armor. A shapechanger is proficient with shields if it is proficient with any type of armor.</li>
</ul>

<p id="swarm"><strong>Swarm Subtype:</strong> A swarm is a collection of Fine, Diminutive, or Tiny creatures that acts as a single creature. A swarm has the characteristics of its type, except as noted here. A swarm has a single pool of Hit Dice and hit points, a single initiative modifier, a single speed, and a single Armor Class. A swarm makes saving throws as a single creature. A single swarm occupies a square (if it is made up of nonflying creatures) or a cube (of flying creatures) 10 feet on a side, but its reach is 0 feet, like its component creatures. In order to attack, it moves into an opponent's space, which provokes an attack of opportunity. It can occupy the same space as a creature of any size, since it crawls all over its prey. A swarm can move through squares occupied by enemies and vice versa without impediment, although the swarm provokes an attack of opportunity if it does so. A swarm can move through cracks or holes large enough for its component creatures.</p>
<p>A swarm of Tiny creatures consists of 300 nonflying creatures or 1,000 flying creatures. A swarm of Diminutive creatures consists of 1,500 nonflying creatures or 5,000 flying creatures. A swarm of Fine creatures consists of 10,000 creatures, whether they are flying or not. Swarms of nonflying creatures include many more creatures than could normally fit in a 10-foot square based on their normal space, because creatures in a swarm are packed tightly together and generally crawl over each other and their prey when moving or attacking. Larger swarms are represented by multiples of single swarms. The area occupied by a large swarm is completely shapeable, though the swarm usually remains in contiguous squares.</p>
<p><em>Traits:</em> A swarm has no clear front or back and no discernable anatomy, so it is not subject to critical hits or flanking. A swarm made up of Tiny creatures takes half damage from slashing and piercing weapons. A swarm composed of Fine or Diminutive creatures is immune to all weapon damage. Reducing a swarm to 0 hit points or lower causes it to break up, though damage taken until that point does not degrade its ability to attack or resist attack. Swarms are never staggered or reduced to a dying state by damage. Also, they cannot be tripped, grappled, or bull rushed, and they cannot grapple an opponent.</p>
<p>A swarm is immune to any spell or effect that targets a specific number of creatures (including single-target spells such as <em>disintegrate</em>), with the exception of mind-affecting effects (charms, compulsions, phantasms, patterns, and morale effects) if the swarm has an Intelligence score and a hive mind. A swarm takes half again as much damage (+50%) from spells or effects that affect an area, such as splash weapons and many evocation spells.</p>
<p>Swarms made up of Diminutive or Fine creatures are susceptible to high winds such as that created by a <em>gust of wind</em> spell. For purposes of determining the effects of wind on a swarm, treat the swarm as a creature of the same size as its constituent creatures. A swarm rendered unconscious by means of nonlethal damage becomes disorganized and dispersed, and does not reform until its hit points exceed its nonlethal damage.</p>
<p><em>Swarm Attack:</em> Creatures with the swarm subtype don't make standard melee attacks. Instead, they deal automatic damage to any creature whose space they occupy at the end of their move, with no attack roll needed. Swarm attacks are not subject to a miss chance for concealment or cover. A swarm's statistics block has "swarm" in the Attack and Full Attack entries, with no attack bonus given. The amount of damage a swarm deals is based on its Hit Dice, as shown below.</p>
<table id="swarm-table" class="table table-bordered table-hover">
    <caption>Table: Swarm Damage</caption>
    <thead>
        <tr><th>Swarm HD</th><th>Swarm Base Damage</th></tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr><td>1-5</td><td>1d6</td></tr>
        <tr><td>6-10</td><td>2d6</td></tr>
        <tr><td>11-15</td><td>3d6</td></tr>
        <tr><td>16-20</td><td>4d6</td></tr>
        <tr><td>21 or more</td><td>5d6</td></tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
<p>{: #asdfasdf .table .table-bordered .table-hover .table-striped data-caption=”asdfasdf” }&lt;p&gt;A swarm’s attacks are nonmagical, unless the swarm’s description states otherwise. Damage reduction sufficient to reduce a swarm attack’s damage to 0, being incorporeal, and other special abilities usually give a creature immunity (or at least resistance) to damage from a swarm. Some swarms also have acid, poison, blood drain, or other special attacks in addition to normal damage.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>Swarms do not threaten creatures in their square, and do not make attacks of opportunity with their swarm attack. However, they distract foes whose squares they occupy, as described below.</p>
<p><em>Distraction (Ex):</em> Any living creature vulnerable to a swarm's damage that begins its turn with a swarm in its square is nauseated for 1 round; a Fortitude save (DC 10 + &#189; swarm's HD + swarm's Con modifier; the exact DC is given in a swarm's description) negates the effect. Spellcasting or concentrating on spells within the area of a swarm requires a <em>concentration</em> check (DC 20 + spell level). Using skills that involve patience and concentration requires a DC 20 <em>concentration</em> check.</p>

<p id="water"><strong>Water Subtype:</strong> This subtype usually is used for elementals and outsiders with a connection to the Elemental Plane of Water. Creatures with the water subtype always have swim speeds and can move in water without making <em>swim</em> checks. A water creature can breathe underwater and usually can breathe air as well.</p>
