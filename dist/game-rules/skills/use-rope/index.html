| Use Rope DC | Task
|-|-
| 10 | Tie a firm knot
| 10&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; | Secure a grappling hook
| 15 | Tie a special knot, such as one that slips, slides slowly, or loosens with a tug
| 15 | Tie a rope around yourself one-handed
| 15 | Splice two ropes together
| Varies | Bind a character
|===
| &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Add 2 to the DC for every 10 feet the hook is thrown; see below. |&lt;
{: #use-rope-table .table .table-bordered .table-hover .table-striped data-caption="Table: _use rope_ DCs" }

_Secure a Grappling Hook:_ Securing a grappling hook requires a _use rope_ check (DC 10, +2 for every 10 feet of distance the grappling hook is thrown, to a maximum DC of 20 at 50 feet). Failure by 4 or less indicates that the hook fails to catch and falls, allowing you to try again. Failure by 5 or more indicates that the grappling hook initially holds, but comes loose after 1d4 rounds of supporting weight. This check is made secretly, so that you don't know whether the rope will hold your weight.

_Bind a Character:_ When you bind another character with a rope, any _escape artist_ check that the bound character makes is opposed by your _use rope_ check.

You get a +10 bonus on this check because it is easier to bind someone than to escape from bonds. You don't even make your _use rope_ check until someone tries to escape.

<tr><td><p>Varies. Throwing a grappling hook is a standard action that provokes an attack of opportunity. Tying a knot, tying a special knot, or tying a rope around yourself one-handed is a full-round action that provokes an attack of opportunity. Splicing two ropes together takes 5 minutes. Binding a character takes 1 minute.</p>
