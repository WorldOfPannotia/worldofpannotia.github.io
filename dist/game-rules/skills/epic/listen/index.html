<p><strong>Defeat Illusion:</strong> The character can automatically detect any illusion with an auditory component for what it truly is. No Will save is required, and the character doesnâ€™t have to interact with the illusion (but he or she must be able to hear its auditory component).</p>

<p><strong>Special:</strong> A character can use <a href="//chimericdream.github.io/worldofpannotia.com/game-rules/skills/#listen" title="Listen"><em>Listen</em></a> to notice the presence of an invisible creature (generally opposed by a <a href="//chimericdream.github.io/worldofpannotia.com/game-rules/skills/#move-silently" title="Move Silently"><em>Move Silently</em></a> check). If the character beats the DC by 20 or more, he or she can pinpoint the location of the invisible creature, though it still maintains total concealment from the character (50% miss chance).</p>
