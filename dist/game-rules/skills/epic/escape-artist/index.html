<p><strong>Extremely Tight Space:</strong> This is the DC for getting through a space when one’s head shouldn’t even be able to fit; this can be as small as 2 inches square for Medium-size creatures. Halve this limit for each size category less than Medium-size; double it for each size category greater than Medium-size. If the space is long, such as in a chimney, multiple checks may be called for.</p>

<p><strong>Pass through Wall of Force:</strong> This allows a character to find a gap of weakness in a <a href="//chimericdream.github.io/worldofpannotia.com/game-rules/magic/spell-index/wall-of-force/" title="Wall of Force"><em>Wall of Force</em></a> (or similar force effect) and squeeze through it.</p>
