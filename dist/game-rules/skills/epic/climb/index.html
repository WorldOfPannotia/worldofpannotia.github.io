<p><strong>Rapid Climbing:</strong> A character can climb his or her speed as a move action, or double his or her speed as a full-round action (requiring two <a href="//chimericdream.github.io/worldofpannotia.com/game-rules/skills/#climb" title="Climb"><em>Climb</em></a> checks), but the character takes a -20 penalty on his or her check.</p>

<p><strong>Special:</strong> The Legendary Climber feat allows a character to ignore any penalties for accelerated or rapid climbing.</p>
