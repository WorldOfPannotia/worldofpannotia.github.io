<p><strong>Swim up Waterfall:</strong> This use of the skill allows a character to swim an angled or vertical surface, as long as he or she remains completely or mostly immersed in water. Other examples might include swimming up a whirlpool or an incredibly large wave.</p>

<p><strong>Speed Swimming:</strong> By taking a -20 penalty on the check, a character can swim his or her speed as a move action, or double his or her speed as a full-round action.</p>
