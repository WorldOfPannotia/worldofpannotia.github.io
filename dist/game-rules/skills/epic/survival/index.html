<p>The character can ignore the effects of terrain on movement and withstand even the harshest weather. If the character is capable of tracking, he or she can identify the races of creatures being tracked.</p>

<p>With a successful check, the character knows the direction to the desired location. This merely points the character in the direction of the location; it doesn’t provide him or her with information on how to get there, nor does it take into account any obstacles in the path.</p>

<p><strong>"Very familiar"</strong> represents a place where the character has been very often and where he or she feels at home.</p>

<p><strong>"Studied carefully"</strong> represents a place the character knows well, either because he or she has been there often or has used other means to study the place.</p>

<p><strong>"Seen casually"</strong> is a place that the character has viewed more than once, but which he or she has not studied.</p>

<p><strong>"Viewed once"</strong> is a place that the character has seen once, possibly using magic.</p>

<p><strong>"Description only"</strong> is a place whose location and appearance the character knows through someone else’s description.</p>
