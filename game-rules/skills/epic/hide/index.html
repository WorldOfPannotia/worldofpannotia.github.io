<p><strong>Hide Another:</strong> By accepting a -30 penalty on his or her <a href="//chimericdream.github.io/worldofpannotia.com/game-rules/skills/#hide" title="Hide"><em>Hide</em></a> check, a character can hide another adjacent creature whose size is no more than one category larger than the characterâ€™s own. Modifiers to the check for the size of the creature still apply, as do all other penalties, including those for moving faster than half speed. Likewise, a character can only hide another creature when it is not under direct observation by a third party. The creature the character hides remains hidden until it is spotted or it takes some other action that breaks its concealment, as normal.</p>
