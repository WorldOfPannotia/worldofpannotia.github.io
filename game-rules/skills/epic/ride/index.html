<p><strong>Stand on Mount:</strong> This allows the character to stand on his or her mount’s back even during movement or combat. The character takes no penalties to actions while doing so.</p>

<p><strong>Unconscious Control:</strong> As a free action, the character can attempt to control a light horse, pony, or heavy horse while in combat. If the character fails, he or she controls the mount as a move action. A character does not need to roll for warhorses or warponies.</p>

<p><strong>Attack from Cover:</strong> The character can react instantly to drop down and hang alongside his or her mount, using it as one-half cover. The character can attack and cast spells while using his or her mount as cover without penalty. If the character fails, he or she doesn’t get the cover benefit.</p>
