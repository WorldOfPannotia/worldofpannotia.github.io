<p><strong>Lift a Sheathed Weapon from Another Creature:</strong> A character may attempt to lift a sheathed weapon from another creature and hide it on his or her person, as long as the weapon is no more than one size category larger than the character’s own size.</p>

<p><strong>Make Object or Creature "Disappear":</strong> A character may attempt to make an adjacent, willing creature or object of his or her size or smaller "disappear" while in plain view. In fact, the willing creature or object is displaced up to 10 feet away – make a separate <a href="//chimericdream.github.io/worldofpannotia.com/game-rules/skills/#hide" title="Hide"><em>Hide</em></a> check to determine how well the "disappeared" creature or object is hidden.</p>
