<p><strong>Identify Basic Property of Magic Item:</strong> This use of the skill requires one round of inspection, and functions exactly as if the character had cast an <a href="//chimericdream.github.io/worldofpannotia.com/game-rules/magic/spell-index/identify/" title="Identify"><em>Identify</em></a> spell on the item. A character can’t attempt this on the same item more than once.</p>

<p><strong>Identify All Properties of Magic Item:</strong> This requires one minute of inspection, and reveals all properties of a single magic item (including command words and charges remaining). A character can’t attempt this on the same item more than once. If an item has different caster levels for different properties, use the highest caster level.</p>

<p><strong>Quick Identification:</strong> A character can identify a substance or potion in the field as a full-round action, without an alchemical lab or any cost. The character can’t retry this check (or take 20); if he or she fails, the character must identify the substance in an alchemical lab, as normal.</p>
