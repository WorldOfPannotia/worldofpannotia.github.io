Silver is a fairly soft but valuable metal. It is more often used for non-combat items, but some societies use silver for ceremonial weaponry and armor. Silver weapons bypass the damage reduction of creatures such as lycanthropes as <a href="Alchemical Silver"></a> weapons do, but they deal an additional {% die_roll 1 6 0 %} of damage to such creatures.

On a successful attack with a silver weapon, the wielder takes a -2 penalty on the damage roll (with the usual minimum of 1 point of damage). This penalty only affects creatures who would not take additional damage from a silver weapon.

Silver typically has 10 hit points per inch of thickness and hardness 5.
