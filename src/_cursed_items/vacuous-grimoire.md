  description: |
    A book of this sort looks like a normal one on some mildly interesting topic. Any character who opens the work and reads so much as a single word therein must make two DC 15 Will saves. The first is to determine if the reader takes 1 point of permanent Intelligence drain. The second is to find out if the reader takes 2 points of permanent Wisdom drain. To destroy the book, a character must burn it while casting {% spell_link remove-curse %}. If the grimoire is placed with other books, its appearance instantly alters to conform to the look of those other works.
