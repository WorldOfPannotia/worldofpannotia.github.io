  description: |
    This cloak is usually made of a woolen material, although it can be made of leather. A {% spell_link detect-poison %} spell can reveal the presence of poison impregnated in the cloak's fabric. The garment can be handled without harm, but as soon as it is actually donned the wearer is killed instantly unless she succeeds on a DC 28 Fortitude save.

    Once donned, a _Cloak of Poisonousness_ can be removed only with a {% spell_link remove-curse %} spell; doing this destroys the magical property of the cloak. If a {% spell_link neutralize-poison %} spell is then used, it is possible to revive the victim with a {% spell_link raise-dead %} or {% spell_link resurrection %} spell, but not before.
