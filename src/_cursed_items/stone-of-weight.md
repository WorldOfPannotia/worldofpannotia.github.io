  description: |
    This stone appears to be a dark, smoothly polished stone. It reduces the possessor's base land speed to one-half of normal. Once picked up, the stone cannot be disposed of by any nonmagical means &ndash; if it is thrown away or smashed, it reappears somewhere on his person. If a {% spell_link remove-curse %} spell is cast upon a _Loadstone_, the item may be discarded normally and no longer haunts the individual.
