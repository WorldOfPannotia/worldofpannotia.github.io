  description: |
    These blocks of incense appear to be {% wondrous_item_link incense-of-meditation %}. If meditation and prayer are conducted while _Incense of Obsession_ is burning nearby, its odor and smoke cause the user to become totally confident that her spell ability is superior, due to the magic incense. The user is determined to use her spells at every opportunity, even when not needed or when useless. The user remains obsessed with her abilities and spells until all have been used or cast, or until 24 hours have elapsed.
