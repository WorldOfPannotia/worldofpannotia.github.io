  description: |
    This bag appears to be an ordinary sack. Detection for magical properties makes it seem as if it were a {% wondrous_item_link bag-of-holding %}. The sack is, however, a lure used by an extradimensional creature &ndash; in fact, one of its feeding orifices.

    Any substance of animal or vegetable nature is subject to &quot;swallowing&quot; if thrust within the bag. The _Bag of Devouring_ is 90% likely to ignore any initial intrusion, but any time thereafter that it senses living flesh within (such as if someone reaches into the bag to pull something out), it is 60% likely to close around the offending member and attempt to draw the whole victim in. The bag has a +8 bonus on grapple checks made to pull someone in.

    The bag can hold up to 30 cubic feet of matter. It acts as a {% wondrous_item_link bag-of-holding 'Bag of Holding Type I'%}, but each hour it has a 5% cumulative chance of swallowing the contents and then spitting the stuff out in some nonspace or on some other plane. Creatures drawn within are consumed in 1 round. The bag destroys the victim's body and prevents any form of raising or resurrection that requires part of the corpse. There is a 50% chance that a {% spell_link wish %}, {% spell_link miracle %}, or {% spell_link true-resurrection %} spell can restore a devoured victim to life. Check once for each destroyed creature. If the check fails, the creature cannot be brought back to life by mortal magic.
