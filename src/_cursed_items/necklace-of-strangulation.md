  description: |
    A _Necklace of Strangulation_ appears to be a rare and wondrous piece of valuable jewelry and, short of the use of something as powerful as a {% spell_link miracle %} or a {% spell_link wish %}, can only be identified as a cursed item when placed around a character's neck. The necklace immediately constricts, dealing 6 points of damage per round. It cannot be removed by any means short of a {% spell_link limited-wish %}, {% spell_link wish %}, or {% spell_link miracle %} and remains clasped around the victim's throat even after his death. Only when he has decayed to a dry skeleton (after approximately one month) does the necklace loosen, ready for another victim.
