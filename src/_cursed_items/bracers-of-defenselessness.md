    These appear to be {% wondrous_item_link bracers-of-armor 'Bracers of Armor +5' %} and actually serve as such until the wearer is attacked in anger by an enemy with a Challenge Rating equal to or greater than her level. At that moment and thereafter, the bracers cause a -5 penalty to AC. Once their curse is activated, _Bracers of Defenselessness_ can be removed only by means of a {% spell_link remove-curse %} spell.
