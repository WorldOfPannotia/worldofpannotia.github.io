  description: |
    A _Robe of Powerlessness_ appears to be a magic robe of another sort. As soon as a character dons this garment, she takes a -10 penalty to Strength and Intelligence, forgetting spells and magic knowledge accordingly. The robe can be removed easily, but in order to restore mind and body, the character must receive a {% spell_link remove-curse %} spell followed by {% spell_link heal %}.
