  description: |
    These boots initially appear and function as one of the other kinds of magic boots. But when the wearer is in (or fleeing from) melee combat, _Boots of Dancing_ impede movement, making him behave as if {% spell_link irresistible-dance %} had been cast upon him. Only a {% spell_link remove-curse %} spell enables the wearer to be rid of the boots once their true nature is revealed.
