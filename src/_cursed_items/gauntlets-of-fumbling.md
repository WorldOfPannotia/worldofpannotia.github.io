  description: |
    These gauntlets may be of supple leather or heavy protective material suitable for use with armor. In the former instance, they appear to be {% wondrous_item_link gloves-of-dexterity %}. In the latter case, they appear to be {% wondrous_item_link gauntlets-of-ogre-power %}. The gauntlets perform according to every test as if they were {% wondrous_item_link gloves-of-dexterity %} or {% wondrous_item_link gauntlets-of-ogre-power %} until the wearer finds herself under attack or in a life-and-death situation. At that time, the curse is activated. The wearer becomes fumble-fingered, with a 50% chance each round of dropping anything held in either hand. The gauntlets also lower Dexterity by 2 points. Once the curse is activated, the gloves can be removed only by means of {% spell_link remove-curse %}, {% spell_link wish %}, or {% spell_link miracle %}.
