  description: |
    This item is indistinguishable in appearance from a normal broom. It is identical to a {% wondrous_item_link broom-of-flying %} by all tests short of attempted use.

    If a command is spoken, the broom does a loop-the-loop with its hopeful rider, dumping him on his head from {% die_roll 1 4 5 %} feet off the ground (no falling damage, since the fall is less than 10 feet). The broom then attacks the victim, swatting the face with the straw or twig end and beating him with the handle end.

    The broom gets two attacks per round with each end (two swats with the straw and two with the handle, for a total of four attacks per round). It attacks with a +5 bonus on each attack roll. The straw end causes a victim to be blinded for 1 round when it hits. The handle deals {% die_roll 1 6 0 %} points of damage when it hits. The broom has AC 13, 18 hit points, and hardness 4.
