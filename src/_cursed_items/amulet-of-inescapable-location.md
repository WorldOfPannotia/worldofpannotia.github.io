  description: |
    This device is typically worn on a chain or as a brooch. It appears, to magical analysis, to prevent location, scrying or detection or influence by {% spell_link detect-thoughts %} or telepathy. It seems to be an {% wondrous_item_link amulet-of-proof-against-detection-and-location %}. Actually, the amulet gives the wearer a -10 penalty on all saves against divination spells.
