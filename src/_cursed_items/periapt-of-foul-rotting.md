  description: |
    This engraved gem appears to be of little value. If any character keeps the periapt in her possession for more than 24 hours, she contracts a terrible rotting affliction that permanently drains 1 point of Dexterity, Constitution, and Charisma every week. The periapt (and the affliction) can be removed only by application of a {% spell_link remove-curse %} spell followed by a {% spell_link remove-disease %} and then a {% spell_link heal %}, {% spell_link miracle %}, {% spell_link limited-wish %}, or {% spell_link wish %} spell. The rotting can also be countered by crushing a {% wondrous_item_link periapt-of-health %} and sprinkling its dust upon the afflicted character (a full-round action), whereupon the _Periapt of Foul Rotting_ likewise crumbles to dust.
