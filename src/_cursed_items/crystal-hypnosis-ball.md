  description: |
    This cursed item is indistinguishable from a normal {% wondrous_item_link crystal-ball %}. However, anyone attempting to use the scrying device becomes fascinated for {% die_roll 1 6 0 %} minutes, and a telepathic {% spell_link suggestion %} is implanted in his mind (Will DC 19 negates).

    The user of the device believes that the desired creature or scene was viewed, but actually he came under the influence of a powerful wizard, lich, or even some power or being from another plane. Each further use brings the _Crystal Hypnosis Ball_ gazer deeper under the influence of the controller, either as a servant or a tool. Note that throughout this time, the user remains unaware of his subjugation.
