  description: |
    These universal items are tiny fragments of cast-off crystal imprinted with minuscule bits of psionic power. Using a _shard_ requires grasping it and projecting a command thought as a standard action (most _shards_ telepathically whisper their command word into the minds of living creatures who handle them). A _shard_ grants a temporary competence bonus on one specific skill, ranging from +1 to +10. The granted bonus lasts until the skill is used or 10 rounds pass, whichever comes first. Once its effect is activated, a _shard_ disintegrates immediately, whether or not the bonus granted by the _shard_ is eventually used.
