  description: |
    These objects appear as small crystals, always with at least one wide, flat facet, and contain a variety of powers. When the owner uses the proper command thought, the crystal adheres to the center of his forehead (the same command thought causes the _third eye_ to disengage). Only one _third eye_ can be worn at a time.

    A _third eye_ is treated as eyewear or goggles for the purpose of determining which items can be worn on the body.

    _Aware:_ This kind of _third eye_ continually grants the wearer a +10 competence bonus on {% skill_link spot %} checks.

    Moderate clairsentience; ML 7th; Craft Universal Item, creator must have 10 ranks in Spot; Price 10,000 gp.

    _Conceal:_ While worn, a _third eye conceal_ protects the wearer from view by all devices, powers, and spells that detect, inf luence, or read emotions or thoughts. This power protects against all mind-affecting powers and effects as well as information-gathering by clairsentience powers or effects (except for _metafaculty_); this item affects the wearer as if he enjoyed the benefit of the _psionic mind blank_ power.

    Strong telepathy; ML 15th; Craft Universal Item, _psionic mind blank_; Price 120,000 gp.

    _Concentrate:_ This kind of _third eye_ continually grants the wearer a +10 competence bonus on {% skill_link concentration %} checks.

    Moderate telepathy; ML 7th; Craft Universal Item, creator must have 10 ranks in Concentration; Price 10,000 gp.

    _Dominate:_ The wearer of a _third eye dominate_ can attempt to dominate a subject as with the power _psionic dominate,_ augmented to target any creature type it can affect, once per day (save DC 18).

    Strong telepathy; ML 15th; Craft Universal Item, _psionic dominate_; Price 120,000 gp.

    _Expose:_ The wearer of this kind of _third eye_ always knows when someone lies directly to him.

    Strong telepathy; ML 15th; Craft Universal Item, _bend reality_; Price 112,000 gp.

    _Gather:_ This kind of _third eye_ continually grants the wearer a +10 competence bonus on {% skill_link gather-information %} checks.

    Moderate clairsentience; ML 7th; Craft Universal Item, creator must have 10 ranks in Gather Information; Price 10,000 gp.

    _Penetrate:_ While worn, a _third eye penetrate_ grants the wearer a +2 bonus on manifester level checks to overcome a creature's power resistance.

    Strong clairsentience; ML 15th; Craft Universal Item, _bend reality_; Price 8,000 gp.

    _Powerthieve:_ While worn, a _third eye powerthieve_ allows the wearer to borrow one power from a psionic target within 40 feet once per day. If the target fails a DC 16 Will save, it instantly loses one power of the wearer's choice, and the wearer instantly gains temporary knowledge of this power.

    The wearer can manifest the borrowed power normally if she has sufficient power points to pay for its cost. The wearer retains knowledge of the power for up to 70 minutes, at which time she loses knowledge of the power and the former owner regains it, regardless of the distance between them. If the former owner is dead, the wearer still loses the borrowed power.

    Moderate telepathy; ML 7th; Craft Universal Item, _thieving mindlink_; Price 10,080 gp.

    _Repudiate:_ While worn, this powerful item allows the wearer to manifest _dispel psionics_ once per day with a +20 modifier on the dispel check (the wearer uses the +20 modifier in place of his manifester level).

    Strong psychokinesis; ML 20th; Craft Universal Item, _dispel psionics_; Price 43,200 gp.

    _Sense_: The wearer of this kind of _third eye_ can manifest _clairvoyant sense_ at will.

    Faint clairsentience; ML 3rd; Craft Universal Item, _clairvoyant sense_; Price 24,000 gp.

    _View:_ The wearer of this kind of _third eye_ can spin a quasireal version of himself and send it over virtually any distance or into other planes of existence, as if manifesting the _remote viewing_ power, once per day.

    Moderate clairsentience; ML 7th; Craft Universal Item, _remote viewing_; Price 10,180 gp.
