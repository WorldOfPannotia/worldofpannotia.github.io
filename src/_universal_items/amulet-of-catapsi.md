  description: |
    This copper amulet aids the wearer against other psionic characters. Once per day, the wearer can mentally command the _catapsi_ power, which blankets a 30- foot-radius area surrounding the wearer in telepathic noise for 9 rounds. Each time other psionic characters within this range attempt to manifest a power, they must succeed on a DC 17 Will save or pay 4 more points than they otherwise would for each power manifestation. The limit on the number of power points a subject can spend on a power remains in effect, so the subject may not be able to manifest his or her highest-level powers.
