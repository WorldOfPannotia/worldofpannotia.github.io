  description: |
    Psychoactive skins (also sometimes called ectoshells) are fistsized globs of psionically charged ectoplasm. As a standard action, a psychoactive skin spreads over and covers a Medium or smaller creature that projects the proper command thought; the same command thought causes the skin to shrink back down to its former size. Each of the various psychoactive skins is charged with one of a wide array of powers that constantly affect the wearer.

    A deployed skin completely covers the wearer and all his equipment like a second skin, allowing the wearer to see, hear, and breathe normally. It rolls away from various parts of the body as needed, such as when the wearer needs to eat or access a backpack. Held items or items specifically excluded are not covered by a psychoactive skin.

    Up to three skins can be worn simultaneously, although only the outermost is active in any given round (the powers of hidden skins cannot be manifested). Skin layers can be changed with a command thought as a standard action, which causes a lower-layer skin to come to the surface.

    _Skin of the Chameleon:_ This psychoactive skin adjusts to surrounding textures and colors, continually granting the wearer a +10 enhancement bonus on {% skill_link hide %} checks.

    Faint psychometabolism; ML 3rd; Craft Universal Item, _chameleon_; Price 18,000 gp; Weight 2 lb.

    _Skin of the Claw:_ This psychoactive skin benefits only a wearer who has levels in psychic warrior. If such a character wears this skin, he can activate the _claws of the beast_ power at will, as a free action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. He can also dismiss the claws equally quickly.

    Faint psychometabolism; ML 4th; Craft Universal Item, _claws of the beast_; Price 16,000 gp; Weight 2 lb.

    _Skin of the Defender:_ This psychoactive skin continually grants the wearer a +4 bonus to natural armor.

    Faint psychometabolism; ML 5th; Craft Universal Item, _thicken skin_; Price 32,000 gp; Weight 2 lb.

    _Skin of Fiery Response:_ This psychoactive skin answers the first attack made against the wearer in each round with an automatically manifested and targeted "ectoburst" against the attacker. The burst ejects from the skin on the wearer's turn, making a ranged touch attack as described in the _energy retort_ power, but the energy type chosen is always fire. If the attack hits, the target takes {% die_roll 2 6 0 %} points of fire damage as the ectoburst flames up and is consumed. This attack does not in any way hinder the wearer, count against her total actions for the round, or provoke attacks of opportunity.

    Faint psychokinesis; ML 5th; Craft Universal Item, _energy retort_; Price 60,000 gp; Weight 2 lb.

    _Skin of the Hero:_ This psychoactive skin continually grants the wearer a +3 deflection bonus to Armor Class, a +3 resistance bonus on all saving throws, and a +3 enhancement bonus on attack rolls.

    Strong psychometabolism; ML 18th; Craft Universal Item, _bend reality_; Price 77,500 gp; Weight 2 lb.

    _Skin of Iron:_ This psychoactive skin affects the wearer as the _psionic iron body_ power up to three times per day for 15 minutes with each use. When the skin's power is not active, it has no protective qualities. Activating the _psionic iron body_ effect is a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity.

    Strong metacreativity; ML 15th; Craft Universal Item, _psionic iron body_; Price 129,600 gp; Weight 2 lb.

    _Skin of Nimbleness:_ This psychoactive skin continually grants the wearer a +10 competence bonus on {% skill_link tumble %} checks.

    Moderate psychometabolism; ML 8th; Craft Universal Item, creator must have 10 ranks in Tumble; Price 10,000 gp; Weight 2 lb.

    _Skin of Proteus:_ This psychoactive skin continually affects the wearer as the _metamorphosis_ power. While in a form other than his natural form, the wearer does not appear to be wearing the skin.

    Moderate psychometabolism; ML 7th; Craft Universal Item, _metamorphosis_; Price 84,000 gp; Weight 2 lb.

    _Skin of the Psion:_ This psychoactive skin grants the wearer 7 bonus power points per day and power resistance 21.

    Strong clairsentience; ML 17th; Craft Universal Item, _power resistance_; Price 151,000 gp; Weight 2 lb.

    _Skin of the Spider:_ This psychoactive skin continually grants the wearer a +20 competence bonus on {% skill_link climb %} checks and continually affects the wearer as the _body equilibrium_ power. Three times per day, the wearer can manifest _entangling ectoplasm_ against a target within 30 feet.

    Faint psychometabolism; ML 3rd; Craft Universal Item, creator must have 10 ranks in Climb, _body equilibrium, entangling ectoplasm_; Price 79,080 gp; Weight 2 lb.

    _Skin of the Troll:_ This psychoactive skin continually allows a living wearer to heal more quickly. The wearer heals 5 points of damage per minute. Except for the slower rate of healing, this skin affects its wearer as if the wearer were under the effect of a continual _true metabolism_ power.

    Strong psychometabolism; ML 17th; Craft Universal Item, _true metabolism_; Price 61,200 gp; Weight 2 lb.
