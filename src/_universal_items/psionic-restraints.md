  description: |
    Each of the various psionic restraints is an iron cuff that cunningly locks around the wrist (DC 27 {% skill_link open-lock %} check). The cuff limits the total number of power points a psionic creature wearing it can use in 1 round (regardless of the creature's total power point reserve), or completely damps the ability to use psionics. All types of psionic restraints prevent the free manifesting of powers.
