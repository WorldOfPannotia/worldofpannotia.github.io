  description: |
    A _crystal anchor_ is a shaft of transparent crystal 4 to 5 feet in length, with a sharpened, spearlike head on one end. It ensnares the minds of those within range who manifest powers of a specified psionic discipline. The triggering discipline is specified at the time of creation.

    A _crystal anchor_ is activated by plunging the sharp head into the ground, leaving the shaft freestanding. It projects an invisible, 30-foot-radius field. If a power from the speci- fied discipline is manifested within this range, the manifester must succeed on a Will save (DC 15 + power level) or become subject to an effect similar to _brain lock_, except that the effect is permanent until dispelled or dismissed by the individual who initially drove the _crystal anchor_ into the earth. Any anchor can be pulled out of the ground and reused at a later time.

    When a _crystal anchor_ successfully ensnares a target, a slender filament of insubstantial ectoplasm connects the victim to the shaft, even one outside the original area of the field.

    A _crystal anchor_ can attempt to ensnare a victim only five times per day. Previously caught targets can remain caught day after day and do not count against this daily limit on attempts.

    An anchor's owner can designate certain creatures to be unaffected by the anchor; such creatures need not make a saving throw and do not count against the daily limit on attempts. One _crystal anchor_ can ensnare multiple targets simultaneously, and multiple _crystal anchors_ can share overlapping fields.

    Anchors that activate when a specific power is manifested in range are also possible, but are rarer.

    A _crystal anchor_ has AC 7, 15 hit points, a hardness of 8, and a break DC of 20.
