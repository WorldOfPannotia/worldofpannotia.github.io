  description: |
    These crystal lenses fit over the user's eyes. Once per day, the wearer is able to drain power points from another psionic creature or character by meeting its gaze as if using _power leech_. A selected target within 40 feet must succeed on a DC 16 Will save, or a connection of crackling energy is formed between the wearer and the victim. The connection drains 1d6 power points from the target for every round in which the wearer maintains concentration (to a maximum of 7 rounds). The wearer gains 1 power point from those drained from the target each round (subject to his normal maximum; points he cannot gain immediately are lost).
    If the wearer has only one lens, the DC of the Will save is 14 instead of 16.
    _Eyes of power leech_ have no effect on nonpsionic targets or psionic creatures with a current power point reserve of 0.
