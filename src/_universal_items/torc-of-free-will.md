  description: |
    This item is a band inlaid with precious metal, worn around the neck or upper arm. The wearer of a _torc of free will_ is not affected by the _brain lock_ power or items that produce _brain lock_ effects (such as _crystal anchors_).

    A torc is treated as an amulet for the purpose of determining which items can be worn on the body.
