  description: |
    This tiny pearly sphere instantly takes on the skin tone and texture of whatever creature handles it. It speeds toward its target when hurled by its owner. He can hurl the pearl at any target within 150 feet that he can see and to which he has line of effect. If the target fails a DC 22 Will saving throw, the pearl seems to impact and then enter the flesh of the target. The target is affected as if by a _mind seed_ power, with the pearl's wielder acting as the manifester. The use destroys the item.
