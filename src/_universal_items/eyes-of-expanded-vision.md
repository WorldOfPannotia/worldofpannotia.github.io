  description: |
    These crystal lenses fit over the user's eyes to expand his field of vision. Flanking opponents gain only a +1 bonus when attacking the user instead of +2 (rogues still get their full sneak attack damage because the wearer is still flanked). The wearer gains a +1 enhancement bonus on {% skill_link spot %} checks but takes a â€“2 penalty on saves against gaze attacks.
