          A plane shaper gains no proficiency with any weapons, armor, or shields.

          At level one, then every even plane shaper level thereafter, the character gains new spells per day (and spells known, if applicable) or power points per day as if he or she had also gained a level in a spellcasting or psionic class to which he or she belonged before adding the prestige class level. If already an epic spellcaster or manifester, the character gains only the benefit noted under the Spells or Psionics entry for that epic class. He or she does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained. If the character had more than one spellcasting or psionic class before becoming a plane shaper, the player must decide to which class to add the new level for the purpose of determining spells or power points per day.

          Starting at 2nd level, the plane shaper develops a natural affinity for one plane that he or she has visited, becoming resistant to any spells and spell-like effects that would normally affect any creature not native to that plane. Every two levels thereafter, the plane shaper gains naturalization to one additional plane.
