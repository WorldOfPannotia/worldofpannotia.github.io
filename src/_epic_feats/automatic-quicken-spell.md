title: "Automatic Quicken Spell"

feat:
  types: ["Epic"]
  prerequisite: |
    Quicken Spell, _spellcraft_ 30 ranks, ability to cast 9th-level arcane or divine spells.
  benefit: |
    The character may cast all 0-, 1st-, 2nd-, and 3rd-level spells as quickened spells without using higher-level spell slots. The normal limit to the number of quickened spells a character may cast per round applies. Spells with a casting time of more than 1 full round can't be quickened.
  special: |
    A character can gain this feat multiple times. Each time a character takes the feat, the spells of his or her next three lowest spell levels can now be quickened with no adjustment to their spell slots. This feat doesn't increase the casting time for those spells that normally become full-round actions when cast in metamagic form.
