title: "Righteous Strike"

feat:
  types: ["Epic"]
  prerequisite: |
    Wis 19, Improved Unarmed Strike, Stunning Fist, any lawful alignment.
  benefit: |
    The character's unarmed strike is treated as an axiomatic weapon (it is lawfully aligned and deals an extra {% die_roll 2 6 0 %} points of damage against creatures of chaotic alignment). This ability doesn't stack with similar abilities.
