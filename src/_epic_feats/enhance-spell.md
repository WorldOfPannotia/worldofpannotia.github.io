title: "Enhance Spell"

feat:
  types: ["Metamagic", "Epic"]
  prerequisite: |
    Maximize Spell.
  benefit: |
    The damage cap for the character's spells increases by 10 dice (for spells that deal a number of dice of damage equal to caster level) or by 5 dice (for spells that deal a number of dice of damage equal to half caster level). An enhanced spell uses up a spell slot four levels higher than the spell's actual level. This feat has no effect on spells that don't specifically deal a number of dice of damage equal to the caster's level or half level, even if the spell's effect is largely dictated by the caster's level.
  normal: |
    Without this feat, use the damage dice caps indicated in the spell's description.
  special: |
    A character may gain this feat multiple times. Each time he or she selects this feat, the damage cap increases by 10 dice or 5 dice, as appropriate to the spell, and the enhanced spell takes up a spell slot an additional four levels higher.
