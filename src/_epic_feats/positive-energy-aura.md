title: "Positive Energy Aura"

feat:
  types: ["Epic"]
  prerequisite: |
    Cha 25, ability to turn undead, ability to cast _dispel evil. _
  benefit: |
    Every undead creature that comes within 15 feet of the character is automatically affected as if the character had turned it. This doesn't cost a turning attempt, and the character doesn't have to roll turning damage (it automatically affects all undead in a 15-foot burst), but it only turns undead with Hit Dice equal to or less than the character's effective cleric level minus 10 (and automatically destroys undead with Hit Dice equal to or less than the character's effective cleric level minus 20). Just as with normal turning, the character can't affect undead that have total cover relative to him or her.
