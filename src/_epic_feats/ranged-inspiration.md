title: "Ranged Inspiration"

feat:
  types: ["Epic"]
  prerequisite: |
    Bardic music class feature, {% skill_link perform %} 25 ranks
  benefit: |
    Double the range of any bardic music ability that has a range. (If the creature must hear the bard to be affected by the ability, that requirement doesn't change regardless of any extended range the bard's ability may have.)
  special: |
    A character can gain this feat multiple times. Its effects stack. Remember that two doublings equals a tripling, and so forth.
