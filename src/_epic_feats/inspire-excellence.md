title: "Inspire Excellence"

feat:
  types: ["Epic"]
  prerequisite: |
    _perform_ 30 ranks, bardic music class feature.
  benefit: |
    The character can use song or poetics to grant a bonus to one ability score to his or her allies. To be affected, an ally must hear the bard sing for 1 full round. The effect lasts as long as the bard sings and for 5 rounds after the bard stops singing (or 5 rounds after the ally can no longer hear the bard). While singing, the bard can fight but cannot cast spells, activate magic items by spell completion (such as scrolls), or activate magic items by command word (such as wands). Each ally to be inspired gains a +4 competence bonus to the same ability score, which the character must choose before he or she begins inspiring. Inspire excellence is a supernatural, mind-affecting ability. Use of this feat counts as one of the character's bardic music uses for the day.
  special: |
    This feat is treated as a bardic music inspiration ability for purposes of feats that affect such abilities.
