feat:
  types: ["Epic"]
  prerequisite: |
    Dex 19, base attack bonus +21, Many-shot, Point Blank Shot, Rapid Shot
  benefit: |
    As Manyshot, but the number of arrows the character can fire is limited only by his or her base attack bonus (two arrows, plus one arrow for every 5 points of base attack bonus above +6).
  special: |
    Regardless of the number of arrows the character fires, he or she only applies precision-based damage (such as sneak attack damage or the ranger's favored enemy bonus) once. If the character scores a critical hit, only one of the arrows deals critical damage (character's choice); all others deal normal damage.
  normal: |
    With the Manyshot feat, the character is limited to a maximum of four arrows fired (when the character's base attack bonus is +16 or higher).
