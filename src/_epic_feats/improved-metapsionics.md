title: "Improved Metapsionics"

feat:
  description: "You can manifest powers using metapsionic feats more easily than normal."
  types: ["Psionic", "Epic"]
  prerequisite: |
    Character level 21st, four metapsionic feats, _psicraft_ 30 ranks.
  benefit: |
    Metapsionic powers you manifest cost 2 power points less than normal (to a minimum of 1 power point).
    This feat has no effect on metapsionic powers that inflate the cost by only 2 power points.
  special: |
    You can gain this feat multiple times. The effects stack, though you can't lower the cost of any metapsionic power to less than 1 power point.
