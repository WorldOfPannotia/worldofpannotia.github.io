title: "Automatic Still Spell"

feat:
  types: ["Epic"]
  prerequisite: |
    Still Spell, {% skill_link spellcraft %} 27 ranks, ability to cast 9th-level arcane or divine spells.
  benefit: |
    The character may cast all 0-, 1st-, 2nd-, and 3rd-level spells as stilled spells without using higher-level spell slots.
  special: |
    A character can gain this feat multiple times. Each time a character takes the feat, the spells of his or her next three lowest spell levels can now be stilled with no adjustment to their spell slots. This feat doesn't increase the casting time for those spells that normally become full-round actions when cast in metamagic form.
