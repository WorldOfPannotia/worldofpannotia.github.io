title: "Tenacious Magic"

feat:
  types: ["Epic"]
  prerequisite: |
    _spellcraft_ 15 ranks.
  benefit: |
    Choose one spell the character knows or spell-like ability the character possesses. Whenever the chosen form of magic would otherwise end due to a _dispel_ effect, the magic is instead only suppressed for 1d4 rounds. The magic still ends when its duration expires, but the suppressed rounds do not count against its duration. The character can dismiss his or her own spell or spell-like ability (if dismissible) or dispel his or her own tenacious magic normally.
  special: |
    A character can gain this feat multiple times. Each time he or she takes the feat, it applies to a different spell or spell-like ability.
