title: "Permanent Emanation"

feat:
  types: ["Epic"]
  prerequisite: |
    {% skill_link spellcraft %} 25 ranks, ability to cast the spell to be made permanent.
  benefit: |
    Designate any one of the character's spells whose area is an emanation from the character. This spell's effect is permanent (though the character can dismiss or restart it as a free action). Effects that would normally dispel this spell instead suppress it for {% die_roll 2 4 0 %} rounds.
  special: |
    This feat may be taken multiple times. Each time, select a different spell to become permanent.
