title: "Legendary Rider"

feat:
  types: ["Epic"]
  prerequisite: |
    _ride_ 24 ranks.
  benefit: |
    The character doesn't take a penalty on _ride_ checks when riding a mount without a saddle (bareback). The character never needs to make a _ride_ check to control a mount in combat (and even controlling a mount not trained for combat doesn't require an action).
  normal: |
    Without this feat, a character takes a -5 penalty on _ride_ checks without a saddle, and must make a _ride_ check to control a mount in combat (and controlling a mount not trained for combat requires a move action).
