title: "Unholy Strike"

feat:
  types: ["Epic"]
  prerequisite: |
    Smite good class feature, any evil alignment.
  benefit: |
    Any weapon the character wields is treated as an unholy weapon (it is evil-aligned and deals an extra {% die_roll 2 6 0 %} points of damage against creatures of good alignment). This ability doesn't stack with similar abilities. If the weapon already has an alignment, this feat has no effect on the weapon.
