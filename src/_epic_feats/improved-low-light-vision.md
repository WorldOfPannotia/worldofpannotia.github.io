title: "Improved Low-light Vision"

feat:
  types: ["Epic"]
  prerequisite: |
    Low-light vision.
  benefit: |
    The range of the character's low-light vision doubles. This feat does not stack with low-light vision granted by magic items or nonpermanent magical effects.
  special: |
    This feat may be taken multiple times. Its effects stack. Remember that two doublings equals a tripling, and so on.
