    **Leadership Score:** A character's Leadership score equals his or her level plus any Charisma modifier. Outside factors can affect a character's Leadership score, as detailed in the Leadership feat.

    **Cohort Level:** The character can attract a cohort of up to this level. Regardless of the character's Leadership score, he or she can't recruit a cohort of his or her level or higher.

    **Number of Followers by Level:** The character can lead up to the indicated number of characters of each level.

    A character can command one-tenth as many 2nd-level followers as 1st-level followers. A character can command one-half as many 3rd-level followers as 2nd-level followers, one-half as many 4th-level followers as 3rd-level followers, and so on (round fractions up, except any fraction less than 1 rounds to 0). A character can't have a follower of higher than 20th level.
