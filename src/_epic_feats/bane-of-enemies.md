title: "Bane of Enemies"

feat:
  types: ["Epic"]
  prerequisite: |
    {% skill_link survival %} 24 ranks, five or more favored enemies.
  benefit: |
    Any weapon the character wields against one of his or her favored enemies is treated as a bane weapon for that creature type (thus, its enhancement bonus is increased by +2 and it deals +{% die_roll 2 6 0 %} points of damage). This ability doesn't stack with similar abilities.
