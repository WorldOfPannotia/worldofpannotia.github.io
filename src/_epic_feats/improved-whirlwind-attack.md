title: "Improved Whirlwind Attack"

feat:
  types: ["Epic"]
  prerequisite: |
    Int 13, Dex 23, {% feat_link combat-expertise %}, Dodge, {% feat_link mobility %}, Spring Attack, Whirlwind Attack.
  benefit: |
    As a standard action, the character can make one melee attack for every five points of his or her base attack bonus (including epic attack bonus, round fractions down).

    The character cannot attack any one opponent more than once as part of this action. These attacks (as well as all other attacks made until the start of the character's next turn) suffer a -4 penalty.

    When using the Improved Whirlwind feat, the character also forfeits any bonus or extra attacks granted by other spells or abilities (such as Cleave or the haste spell).

    Since these attacks are made as part of a standard action the character can't make a 5-foot step between any two of the attacks.
  normal: |
    Without this feat, using the Whirlwind Attack feat requires a full attack action, and the character can take a 5-foot step between any two of the attacks.
