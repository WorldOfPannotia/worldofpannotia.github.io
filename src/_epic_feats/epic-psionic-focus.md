title: "Epic Psionic Focus"

feat:
  description: "You can expend your psionic focus to greater effect."
  types: ["PSionic", "Epic"]
  prerequisite: |
    Character level 21st, ability to manifest powers of the normal maximum power level in at least one psionic class.
  benefit: |
    When you expend your psionic focus, you can simultaneously use two feats that require a psionic focus to be expended, instead of just one. The feats must be stackable. You must still spend the requisite power points required to use each metapsionic feat, and you cannot exceed the power point limit set by your manifester level.
  special: |
    You can take this feat multiple times. Each time you do so, you can simultaneously use one additional feat that requires a psionic focus to be expended.
