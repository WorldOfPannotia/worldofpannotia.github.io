title: "Chaotic Rage"

feat:
  types: ["Epic"]
  prerequisite: |
    Rage 5/day, chaotic alignment.
  benefit: |
    Any weapon the character wields while in a rage is treated as an anarchic weapon (it is chaos-aligned and deals an extra 2d6 points of damage against creatures of lawful alignment). This ability does not stack with similar abilities.
