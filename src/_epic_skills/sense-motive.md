**Discern Partial Alignment:** This use of the skill lets a character discern one component of a target's alignment. When making the check, the character states whether he or she is trying to discern the law/chaos or good/evil component. A character can't retry the check, and he or she can't use this to discern more than one component of the alignment (but see below). The target must be visible and within 30 feet of the character.

**Discern Full Alignment:** This use of the skill lets a character determine both components of a target's alignment. The character can't retry the check. The target must be visible and within 30 feet of the character.

**Detect Surface Thoughts:** This lets a character read the surface thoughts of a single target (as the 3rd-round effect of the {% spell_link detect-thoughts %} spell). There is no saving throw to resist this effect, though the target can use {% skill_link bluff %} to disguise his or her surface thoughts (see the epic skill description for {% epic_skill_link bluff %}), in which case this becomes an opposed check (any result lower than 100 automatically fails). The target must be visible and within 30 feet of the character.
