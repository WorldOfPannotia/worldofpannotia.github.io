With a successful check, the character knows the direction to the desired location. This merely points the character in the direction of the location; it doesn't provide him or her with information on how to get there, nor does it take into account any obstacles in the path.

**&quot;Very familiar&quot;** represents a place where the character has been very often and where he or she feels at home.

**&quot;Studied carefully&quot;** represents a place the character knows well, either because he or she has been there often or has used other means to study the place.

**&quot;Seen casually&quot;** is a place that the character has viewed more than once, but which he or she has not studied.

**&quot;Viewed once&quot;** is a place that the character has seen once, possibly using magic.

**&quot;Description only&quot;** is a place whose location and appearance the character knows through someone else's description.
