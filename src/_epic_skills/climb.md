**Rapid Climbing:** A character can climb his or her speed as a move action, or double his or her speed as a full-round action (requiring two {% skill_link climb %} checks), but the character takes a -20 penalty on his or her check.

**Special:** The Legendary Climber feat allows a character to ignore any penalties for accelerated or rapid climbing.
