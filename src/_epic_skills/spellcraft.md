**Identify Basic Property of Magic Item:** This use of the skill requires one round of inspection, and functions exactly as if the character had cast an {% spell_link identify %} spell on the item. A character can't attempt this on the same item more than once.

**Identify All Properties of Magic Item:** This requires one minute of inspection, and reveals all properties of a single magic item (including command words and charges remaining). A character can't attempt this on the same item more than once. If an item has different caster levels for different properties, use the highest caster level.

**Quick Identification:** A character can identify a substance or potion in the field as a full-round action, without an alchemical lab or any cost. The character can't retry this check (or take 20); if he or she fails, the character must identify the substance in an alchemical lab, as normal.
