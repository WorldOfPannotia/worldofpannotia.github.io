**Quick Splicing:** The character can splice two ropes together as a move action.

**Tie Unique Knot:** The character can tie a knot that only he or she knows how to untie. This doesn't affect any {% skill_link escape-artist %} checks made to escape these bindings.

**Animate Held Rope:** The character can command any rope he or she holds as if it had the {% spell_link animate-rope %} spell cast upon it (except that using the skill in this way doesn't grant any bonus on {% skill_link use-rope %} checks made with the animated rope). Each command requires a separate {% skill_link use-rope %} check. Because the effect isn't magical, it can't be dispelled.
