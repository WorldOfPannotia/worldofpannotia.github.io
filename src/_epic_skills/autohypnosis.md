**Continue Taking Actions While at Negative Hit Points:** If reduced to negative hit points but not dead, make an {% skill_link autohypnosis %} check. If successful, the character does not go unconscious and can continue taking actions until he or she bleeds to death or stabilizes (the character can also continue making stabilization checks). If healed or stabilized, the character continues to take actions normally.

**Resist Secondary Poison Damage:** When poisoned, the character can make an {% skill_link autohypnosis %} check on his or her next action. A successful check indicates the character does not have to make a saving throw against the poison's secondary damage, which he or she instead automatically ignores.

**Gain a Save or Retry a Failed Save Against a Mind-affecting Effect:** If a failed saving throw indicates the character is affected by any mind-affecting powers, spells, or spell-like effects, a successful {% skill_link autohypnosis %} check allows an immediate second saving throw to resist the effect. If the mind-affecting effect normally does not allow a saving throw, a successful {% skill_link autohypnosis %} check allows a saving throw.

**Gain Temporary Hit Points:** With a successful {% skill_link autohypnosis %} check, the character gains temporary hit points equal to 10 + his or her Wisdom modifier. The temporary hit points persist until lost. A character cannot check for temporary hit points more than once per day. Temporary hit points gained through {% skill_link autohypnosis %} do not stack with temporary hit points gained through any other source.

**Gain Damage Reduction 2/&ndash;:** On a successful {% skill_link autohypnosis %} check, the character gains damage reduction 2/&ndash;. The damage reduction lasts for 12 hours. The character cannot check for damage reduction more than once per day. Damage reduction gained through {% skill_link autohypnosis %} does not stack with damage reduction gained through any other source.
