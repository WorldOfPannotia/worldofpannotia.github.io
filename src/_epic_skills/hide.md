**Hide Another:** By accepting a -30 penalty on his or her {% skill_link hide %} check, a character can hide another adjacent creature whose size is no more than one category larger than the character's own. Modifiers to the check for the size of the creature still apply, as do all other penalties, including those for moving faster than half speed. Likewise, a character can only hide another creature when it is not under direct observation by a third party. The creature the character hides remains hidden until it is spotted or it takes some other action that breaks its concealment, as normal.
