**Instill Suggestion in Target:** This is identical to the effect of the {% spell_link suggestion %} spell, except that it is non-magical and lasts for only 10 minutes. It can be sensed as if it were an enchantment effect ({% skill_link sense-motive %} DC 25).

**Display False Alignment:** The character can fool alignment-sensing effects by displaying a false alignment of his or her choice. Once set, a false alignment remains as long as the character remains conscious and awake. Setting or changing a false alignment requires a full-round action.

**Disguise Surface Thoughts:** The character can fool spells such as {% spell_link detect-thoughts %} (or similar effects) by displaying false surface thoughts. While the character can't completely mask the presence of his or her thoughts, he or she can change his or her apparent Intelligence score (and thus the character's apparent mental strength) by as much as 10 points and can place any thought in his or her &quot;surface thoughts&quot; to be read by such spells or effects. If a character attempts to use {% skill_link sense-motive %} to detect his or her surface thoughts (see the {% skill_link sense-motive %} skill description), this becomes an opposed check (though any result lower than 100 automatically fails).
