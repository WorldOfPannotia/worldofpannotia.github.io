**Defeat Illusion:** The character can automatically detect any illusion with an auditory component for what it truly is. No Will save is required, and the character doesn't have to interact with the illusion (but he or she must be able to hear its auditory component).

**Special:** A character can use {% skill_link listen %} to notice the presence of an invisible creature (generally opposed by a {% skill_link move-silently %} check). If the character beats the DC by 20 or more, he or she can pinpoint the location of the invisible creature, though it still maintains total concealment from the character (50% miss chance).
