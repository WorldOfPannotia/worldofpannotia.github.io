**Extremely Tight Space:** This is the DC for getting through a space when one's head shouldn't even be able to fit; this can be as small as 2 inches square for Medium-size creatures. Halve this limit for each size category less than Medium-size; double it for each size category greater than Medium-size. If the space is long, such as in a chimney, multiple checks may be called for.

**Pass through Wall of Force:** This allows a character to find a gap of weakness in a {% spell_link wall-of-force %} (or similar force effect) and squeeze through it.
