Weapons found on Table: Weapons that have special options for the wielder ("you") are described below. Splash weapons are described under Special Substances and Items.

**Arrows:** An arrow used as a melee weapon is treated as a light improvised weapon (-4 penalty on attack rolls) and deals damage as a dagger of its size (critical multiplier &times;2). Arrows come in a leather quiver that holds 20 arrows. An arrow that hits its target is destroyed; one that misses has a 50% chance of being destroyed or lost.

**Arrows, Alchemical:** These arrows have relatively normal fletching and shafts, but the head is made of a small glass vial. The vial is designed to break upon impact, and it contains a dose of one of the following items: <a href="#">Acid</a>, <a href="#">Alchemist's Fire</a>, or <a href="#">Holy Water</a>.

Upon a successful hit, the vial breaks and affects the target accordingly. However, the damage for the respective type of substance is reduced to 1d4, and there is no splash damage. The effects are otherwise the same as with the normal substances.

Due to the unusual balance and weight of an alchemical arrow, shooting one incurs a -5 penalty on the attack roll, and the range increment is halved. If the attack misses, roll 1d8 and determine the square that the arrow hit as per the rules on <a href="#">throwing a splash weapon</a>.

The price of an alchemical arrow includes a small dose of the substance in question.

**Arrows, Barbed:** Barbed arrows have jagged hooks along the shaft and on the head of the arrow. These hooks point toward the fletching of the arrow. The hooks serve to keep the arrow attached to its target and deal additional damage when the arrow is removed. In order for a creature to safely remove a barbed arrow from themselves, they must succeed on a DC 25 heal check. If someone else performs this task, the check is reduced to DC 20. Removing a single barbed arrow takes a full-round action. If the heal check is unsuccessful, the arrow is still removed from the creature, but they take additional damage equal to the normal damage for the arrow (minus any magical effects such as flaming or frost).

Because barbed arrows do not fly as straight as normal arrows, any creature firing with them takes a -2 penalty to the attack roll. In addition, the arrows have only 75% the normal range increment.

**Arrows, Flight:** Flight arrows are thinner, shorter, and have smaller heads than a normal arrow. They are designed to fly farther than standard arrows, though they cause less damage. These arrows increase the range of the arrow by 50%, and the damage is reduced by one die type.

**Arrows, Rope Cutting:** Rope cutting arrows are commonly used by individuals who are intending to cause distraction or sabotage. Because ropes are nearly impossible to hit and sever with a normal arrow, these arrows are specially made to cut through. The arrowhead is shaped like a "V", with the inner sides of the head sporting sharp blades. When the arrow is strikes a taut rope or cord, treat the rope's hardness as being half what it normall is. In addition, the arrow deals double damage to the rope. When fired at a normal target (such as in combat), the arrow deals damage of one die type less than normal.

**Arrows &amp; Bolts, Signal:** The signal arrow and signal bolt are both created for use by those who stand sentry, typically used by the night watch of cities rich enough to afford the moderately expensive ammunition.

The signal arrow is made entirely out of steel, with a blunt, hollow tip. The tip is made to be filled with oil, and stopped with a piece of flint. The piece of flint, in turn, is attached to a small wire with a hoop or bar on the end. When the arrow is fired, the guard holds on to the wire, so that the flint is pulled free and provides a spark to ignite the oil which sprays out in a fine mist as the arrow travels, causing a burst of fire in the air following the missile's trajectory. In addition, the tip is engineered to emit a high-pitched screech as it flies. The signal arrow is typically shot high into the air to alert others of trouble, and the combination of auditory and visual stimuli is usually enough so that all within several hundred feet know of the disturbance. Properly preparing to fire a signal arrow requires a move action unless you possess the Quick Draw feat, in which case it is a swift action.

A signal bolt is essentially the same as a signal arrow, except engineered to fit in and be fired from a crossbow. In addition, the wire holding the flint stopper is always terminated by a ring, which is attached to a hook on the crossbow. Loading a signal bolt correctly requires a full-round action, or a standard action if you have the Rapid Reload feat. For this reason, guards using a signal bolt typically keep it loaded in the crossbow at all times, as it's extremely cumbersome to load when a situation demands.

Signal arrows and bolts are both reusable, as long as both the flint stopper and arrow/bolt are both recovered. It's a relatively simple matter to refill the head with oil, although care should be taken when inserting the stopper so as not to set it off.

Due to the unusual balance and weight of signal arrows &amp; bolts, they are not suited for normal combat. They deal only subdual damage based on their size, shooting one incurs a -5 penalty on the attack roll, and the range increment is halved. If the attack misses, roll 1d8 and determine the square that the arrow hit as per the rules on <a href="#">throwing a splash weapon</a>.

**Axe, Orc Double:** An orc double axe is a double weapon. You can fight with it as if fighting with two weapons, but if you do, you incur all the normal attack penalties associated with fighting with two weapons, just as if you were using a one-handed weapon and a light weapon.

A creature wielding an orc double axe in one hand can't use it as a double weapon &ndash; only one end of the weapon can be used in any given round.

**Bolas:** You can use this weapon to make a ranged trip attack against an opponent. You can't be tripped during your own trip attempt when using a set of bolas.

**Bolts:** A crossbow bolt used as a melee weapon is treated as a light improvised weapon (-4 penalty on attack rolls) and deals damage as a dagger of its size (crit &times;2). Bolts come in a wooden case that holds 10 bolts (or 5, for a repeating crossbow). A bolt that hits its target is destroyed; one that misses has a 50% chance of being destroyed or lost.

**Bullets, Sling:** Bullets come in a leather pouch that holds 10 bullets. A bullet that hits its target is destroyed; one that misses has a 50% chance of being destroyed or lost.

**Chain, Spiked:** A spiked chain has reach, so you can strike opponents 10 feet away with it. In addition, unlike most other weapons with reach, it can be used against an adjacent foe.

You can make trip attacks with the chain. If you are tripped during your own trip attempt, you can drop the chain to avoid being tripped.

When using a spiked chain, you get a +2 bonus on opposed attack rolls made to disarm an opponent (including the roll to avoid being disarmed if such an attempt fails).

You can use the Weapon Finesse feat to apply your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier to attack rolls with a spiked chain sized for you, even though it isn't a light weapon for you.

**Crossbow, Hand:** You can draw a hand crossbow back by hand. Loading a hand crossbow is a move action that provokes attacks of opportunity.

You can shoot, but not load, a hand crossbow with one hand at no penalty. You can shoot a hand crossbow with each hand, but you take a penalty on attack rolls as if attacking with two light weapons.

**Crossbow, Heavy:** You draw a heavy crossbow back by turning a small winch. Loading a heavy crossbow is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity.

Normally, operating a heavy crossbow requires two hands. However, you can shoot, but not load, a heavy crossbow with one hand at a -4 penalty on attack rolls. You can shoot a heavy crossbow with each hand, but you take a penalty on attack rolls as if attacking with two one-handed weapons. This penalty is cumulative with the penalty for one-handed firing.

**Crossbow, Light:** You draw a light crossbow back by pulling a lever. Loading a light crossbow is a move action that provokes attacks of opportunity.

Normally, operating a light crossbow requires two hands. However, you can shoot, but not load, a light crossbow with one hand at a -2 penalty on attack rolls. You can shoot a light crossbow with each hand, but you take a penalty on attack rolls as if attacking with two light weapons. This penalty is cumulative with the penalty for one-handed firing.

**Crossbow, Repeating:** The repeating crossbow (whether heavy or light) holds 5 crossbow bolts. As long as it holds bolts, you can reload it by pulling the reloading lever (a free action). Loading a new case of 5 bolts is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity.

You can fire a repeating crossbow with one hand or fire a repeating crossbow in each hand in the same manner as you would a normal crossbow of the same size. However, you must fire the weapon with two hands in order to use the reloading lever, and you must use two hands to load a new case of bolts.

**Dagger:** You get a +2 bonus on Sleight of Hand checks made to conceal a dagger on your body (see the Sleight of Hand skill).

**Flail, Dire:** A dire flail is a double weapon. You can fight with it as if fighting with two weapons, but if you do, you incur all the normal attack penalties associated with fighting with two weapons, just as if you were using a one-handed weapon and a light weapon. A creature wielding a dire flail in one hand can't use it as a double weapon &ndash; only one end of the weapon can be used in any given round.

When using a dire flail, you get a +2 bonus on opposed attack rolls made to disarm an enemy (including the opposed attack roll to avoid being disarmed if such an attempt fails).

You can also use this weapon to make trip attacks. If you are tripped during your own trip attempt, you can drop the dire flail to avoid being tripped.

**Flail or Heavy Flail:** With a flail, you get a +2 bonus on opposed attack rolls made to disarm an enemy (including the roll to avoid being disarmed if such an attempt fails).

You can also use this weapon to make trip attacks. If you are tripped during your own trip attempt, you can drop the flail to avoid being tripped.

**Fullblade:** A fullblade is nearly two feet longer than a greatsword, and is a great deal heavier. A fullblade cannot be used by characters smaller than those for whom it was made for (i.e. a Medium fullblade cannot be used by a Small character).

**Gauntlet:** This metal glove lets you deal lethal damage rather than nonlethal damage with unarmed strikes. A strike with a gauntlet is otherwise considered an unarmed attack. The cost and weight given are for a single gauntlet. Medium and heavy armors (except breastplate) come with gauntlets.

**Gauntlet, Spiked:** Your opponent cannot use a disarm action to disarm you of spiked gauntlets. The cost and weight given are for a single gauntlet. An attack with a spiked gauntlet is considered an armed attack.

**Glaive:** A glaive has reach. You can strike opponents 10 feet away with it, but you can't use it against an adjacent foe.

**Great Boomerang:** The great boomerang is a curved piece of wood approximately seven feet from tip to tip designed specifically for throwing. Because of its size, the great boomerang must be thrown with two hands. At the center of the shaft, several thick bands of leather have been wrapped around the great boomerang, and two handles have been attached.

The boomerang returns at the end of a character's turn during which it is thrown. To catch a returning boomerang, the thrower must be in the square from which the boomerang was thrown, and must have both hands free (holding nothing). The thrower makes an attack roll using the attack bonus used to make the attack against AC 20. If successful, he catches the boomerang. Failure indicates that the great boomerang strikes the character (dealing normal damage) and falls to the ground nearby, using the grenade-like weapons diagram (page 138, PHB) to determine the exact position.

The thrower adds his strength modifier to the damage of a great boomerang, and any character with a strength lower than 18 cannot exert enough force to throw a great boomerang in a lethal attack.

This weapon cannot be used in melee combat.

**Guisarme:** A guisarme has reach. You can strike opponents 10 feet away with it, but you can't use it against an adjacent foe.

You can also use it to make trip attacks. If you are tripped during your own trip attempt, you can drop the guisarme to avoid being tripped.

**Halberd:** If you use a ready action to set a halberd against a charge, you deal double damage on a successful hit against a charging character.

You can use a halberd to make trip attacks. If you are tripped during your own trip attempt, you can drop the halberd to avoid being tripped.

**Hammer, Gnome Hooked:** A gnome hooked hammer is a double weapon. You can fight with it as if fighting with two weapons, but if you do, you incur all the normal attack penalties associated with fighting with two weapons, just as if you were using a one-handed weapon and a light weapon. The hammer's blunt head is a bludgeoning weapon that deals 1d6 points of damage (crit &times;3). Its hook is a piercing weapon that deals 1d4 points of damage (crit &times;4). You can use either head as the primary weapon. The other head is the offhand weapon. A creature wielding a gnome hooked hammer in one hand can't use it as a double weapon &ndash; only one end of the weapon can be used in any given round.

You can use a gnome hooked hammer to make trip attacks. If you are tripped during your own trip attempt, you can drop the gnome hooked hammer to avoid being tripped.

Gnomes treat gnome hooked hammers as martial weapons.

**Javelin:** Since it is not designed for melee, you are treated as nonproficient with it and take a -4 penalty on attack rolls if you use a javelin as a melee weapon.

**Kama:** The kama is a special monk weapon. This designation gives a monk wielding a kama special options.

You can use a kama to make trip attacks. If you are tripped during your own trip attempt, you can drop the kama to avoid being tripped.

**Lance:** A lance deals double damage when used from the back of a charging mount. It has reach, so you can strike opponents 10 feet away with it, but you can't use it against an adjacent foe.

While mounted, you can wield a lance with one hand.

**Longbow:** You need at least two hands to use a bow, regardless of its size. A longbow is too unwieldy to use while you are mounted. If you have a penalty for low Strength, apply it to damage rolls when you use a longbow. If you have a bonus for high Strength, you can apply it to damage rolls when you use a composite longbow (see below) but not a regular longbow.

**Longbow, Composite:** You need at least two hands to use a bow, regardless of its size. You can use a composite longbow while mounted. All composite bows are made with a particular strength rating (that is, each requires a minimum Strength modifier to use with proficiency). If your Strength bonus is less than the strength rating of the composite bow, you can't effectively use it, so you take a -2 penalty on attacks with it. The default composite longbow requires a Strength modifier of +0 or higher to use with proficiency. A composite longbow can be made with a high strength rating to take advantage of an above-average Strength score; this feature allows you to add your Strength bonus to damage, up to the maximum bonus indicated for the bow. Each point of Strength bonus granted by the bow adds 100 gp to its cost.

For purposes of weapon proficiency and similar feats, a composite longbow is treated as if it were a longbow.

**Longbow, Variable Composite:** You need at least two hands to use a bow, regardless of its size. You can use a variable composite longbow while mounted. All variable composite bows are made with a maximum strength rating (that is, each can be set to a range of Strength modifiers as in normal composite bows). If your Strength bonus is less than the current strength rating of the variable composite bow, you can't effectively use it, so you take a -2 penalty on attacks with it. The default variable composite longbow has a maximum Strength modifier of +0. A variable composite longbow can be made with a high maximum strength rating to take advantage of an above-average Strength score; this feature allows you to add your Strength bonus to damage, up to the maximum bonus indicated for the bow. Each point of Strength bonus granted by the bow adds 100 gp to its cost.

To change the strength setting for a variable composite bow, a character must make a DC 15 _craft (bowmaking)_ check. Successfully changing the strength rating of the bow takes 1 minute.

For purposes of weapon proficiency and similar feats, a variable composite longbow is treated as if it were a longbow.

**Longspear:** A longspear has reach. You can strike opponents 10 feet away with it, but you can't use it against an adjacent foe. If you use a ready action to set a longspear against a charge, you deal double damage on a successful hit against a charging character.

**Net:** A net is used to entangle enemies. When you throw a net, you make a ranged touch attack against your target. A net's maximum range is 10 feet. If you hit, the target is entangled. An entangled creature takes a -2 penalty on attack rolls and a -4 penalty on Dexterity, can move at only half speed, and cannot charge or run. If you control the trailing rope by succeeding on an opposed Strength check while holding it, the entangled creature can move only within the limits that the rope allows. If the entangled creature attempts to cast a spell, it must make a DC 15 Concentration check or be unable to cast the spell.

An entangled creature can escape with a DC 20 Escape Artist check (a full-round action). The net has 5 hit points and can be burst with a DC 25 Strength check (also a full-round action).

A net is useful only against creatures within one size category of you.

A net must be folded to be thrown effectively. The first time you throw your net in a fight, you make a normal ranged touch attack roll. After the net is unfolded, you take a -4 penalty on attack rolls with it. It takes 2 rounds for a proficient user to fold a net and twice that long for a nonproficient one to do so.

**Nunchaku:** The nunchaku is a special monk weapon. This designation gives a monk wielding a nunchaku special options. With a nunchaku, you get a +2 bonus on opposed attack rolls made to disarm an enemy (including the roll to avoid being disarmed if such an attempt fails).

**Quarterstaff:** A quarterstaff is a double weapon. You can fight with it as if fighting with two weapons, but if you do, you incur all the normal attack penalties associated with fighting with two weapons, just as if you were using a one-handed weapon and a light weapon. A creature wielding a quarterstaff in one hand can't use it as a double weapon &ndash; only one end of the weapon can be used in any given round.

The quarterstaff is a special monk weapon. This designation gives a monk wielding a quarterstaff special options.

**Rapier:** You can use the Weapon Finesse feat to apply your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier to attack rolls with a rapier sized for you, even though it isn't a light weapon for you. You can't wield a rapier in two hands in order to apply 1&#189; times your Strength bonus to damage.

**Sai:** With a sai, you get a +4 bonus on opposed attack rolls made to disarm an enemy (including the roll to avoid being disarmed if such an attempt fails).

All composite bows are made with a particular strength rating (that is, each requires a minimum Strength modifier to use with proficiency). If your Strength bonus is lower than the strength rating of the composite bow, you can't effectively use it, so you take a -2 penalty on attacks with it. The default composite shortbow requires a Strength modifier of +0 or higher to use with proficiency. A composite shortbow can be made with a high strength rating to take advantage of an above-average Strength score; this feature allows you to add your Strength bonus to damage, up to the maximum bonus indicated for the bow.

**Shuriken:** A shuriken is a special monk weapon. This designation gives a monk wielding shuriken special options. A shuriken can't be used as a melee weapon.

**Siangham:** The siangham is a special monk weapon. This designation gives a monk wielding a siangham special options.

**Sickle:** A sickle can be used to make trip attacks. If you are tripped during your own trip attempt, you can drop the sickle to avoid being tripped.

**Sling:** Your Strength modifier applies to damage rolls when you use a sling, just as it does for thrown weapons. You can fire, but not load, a sling with one hand. Loading a sling is a move action that requires two hands and provokes attacks of opportunity.

You can hurl ordinary stones with a sling, but stones are not as dense or as round as bullets. Thus, such an attack deals damage as if the weapon were designed for a creature one size category smaller than you and you take a -1 penalty on attack rolls.

**Spear:** A spear can be thrown. If you use a ready action to set a spear against a charge, you deal double damage on a successful hit against a charging character.

**Spiked Armor:** You can outfit your armor with spikes, which can deal damage in a grapple or as a separate attack. See Armor for details.

**Spiked Shield, Heavy or Light:** You can bash with a spiked shield instead of using it for defense. See Armor for details.

A monk or any character with the Improved Unarmed Strike feat can deal lethal or nonlethal damage with unarmed strikes, at her option. The damage from an unarmed strike is considered weapon damage for the purposes of effects that give you a bonus on weapon damage rolls.

An unarmed strike is always considered a light weapon. Therefore, you can use the Weapon Finesse feat to apply your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier to attack rolls with an unarmed strike.

**Sword, Bastard:** A bastard sword is too large to use in one hand without special training; thus, it is an exotic weapon. A character can use a bastard sword two-handed as a martial weapon.

**Sword, Two-Bladed:** A two-bladed sword is a double weapon. You can fight with it as if fighting with two weapons, but if you do, you incur all the normal attack penalties associated with fighting with two weapons, just as if you were using a one-handed weapon and a light weapon. A creature wielding a two-bladed sword in one hand can't use it as a double weapon &ndash; only one end of the weapon can be used in any given round.

**Trident:** This weapon can be thrown. If you use a ready action to set a trident against a charge, you deal double damage on a successful hit against a charging character.

**Urgrosh, Dwarven:** A dwarven urgrosh is a double weapon. You can fight with it as if fighting with two weapons, but if you do, you incur all the normal attack penalties associated with fighting with two weapons, just as if you were using a one-handed weapon and a light weapon. The urgrosh's axe head is a slashing weapon that deals 1d8 points of damage. Its spear head is a piercing weapon that deals 1d6 points of damage. You can use either head as the primary weapon. The other is the off-hand weapon. A creature wielding a dwarven urgrosh in one hand can't use it as a double weapon &ndash; only one end of the weapon can be used in any given round.

If you use a ready action to set an urgrosh against a charge, you deal double damage if you score a hit against a charging character. If you use an urgrosh against a charging character, the spear head is the part of the weapon that deals damage.

Dwarves treat dwarven urgroshes as martial weapons.

**Waraxe, Dwarven:** A dwarven waraxe is too large to use in one hand without special training; thus, it is an exotic weapon. A Medium character can use a dwarven waraxe two-handed as a martial weapon, or a Large creature can use it one-handed in the same way. A dwarf treats a dwarven waraxe as a martial weapon even when using it in one hand.

**Whip:** A whip deals nonlethal damage. It deals no damage to any creature with an armor bonus of +1 or higher or a natural armor bonus of +3 or higher. The whip is treated as a melee weapon with 15-foot reach, though you don't threaten the area into which you can make an attack. In addition, unlike most other weapons with reach, you can use it against foes anywhere within your reach (including adjacent foes).

Using a whip provokes an attack of opportunity, just as if you had used a ranged weapon.

You can make trip attacks with a whip. If you are tripped during your own trip attempt, you can drop the whip to avoid being tripped.

When using a whip, you get a +2 bonus on opposed attack rolls made to disarm an opponent (including the roll to keep from being disarmed if the attack fails).

You can use the Weapon Finesse feat to apply your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier to attack rolls with a whip sized for you, even though it isn't a light weapon for you.
