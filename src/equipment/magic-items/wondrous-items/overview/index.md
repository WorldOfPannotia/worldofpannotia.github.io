This is a catch-all category for anything that doesn't fall into the other groups. Anyone can use a wondrous item (unless specified otherwise in the description).

**Physical Description:** Varies.

**Activation:** Usually use activated or command word, but details vary from item to item.

**Special Qualities:** Roll d%. An 01 result indicates the wondrous item is intelligent, 02-31 indicates that something (a design, inscription, or the like) provides a clue to its function, and 32-100 indicates no special qualities. Intelligent items have extra abilities and sometimes extraordinary powers and special purposes.

Wondrous items with charges can never be intelligent.
