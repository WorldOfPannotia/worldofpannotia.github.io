Rods are generally scepterlike devices that have unique magical powers and do not usually have charges. Anyone can use a rod.

**Physical Description:** Rods weigh approximately 5 pounds.

They range from 2 feet to 3 feet long and are usually made of iron or some other metal. (Many, as noted in their descriptions, can function as light maces or clubs due to their sturdy construction.)

These sturdy items have AC 9, 10 hit points, hardness 10, and a break DC of 27.

**Activation:** Details relating to rod use vary from item to item. See the individual descriptions for specifics.

**Special Qualities:** Roll d%. A 01 result indicates the rod is intelligent, 02-31 indicates that something (a design, inscription, or the like) provides a clue to its function, and 32-100 indicates no special qualities. Intelligent items have extra abilities and sometimes extraordinary powers and special purposes.

Rods with charges can never be intelligent.
