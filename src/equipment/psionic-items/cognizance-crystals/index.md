_Cognizance crystals_ store power points that psionic characters can use to pay for manifesting their powers.

**Physical Description:** A _cognizance crystal_ consists of a core crystal and two or three smaller crystals arranged in specific positions around it on strands of silver wire. The crystals give off a faint glow. A typical _cognizance crystal_ weighs approximately 1 pound, has AC 7, 10 hit points, a hardness of 8, and a break DC of 16.

**Activation:** The user must merely hold or have a crystal on her person for a period of at least 10 minutes (which is long enough to attune oneself to the crystal). Thereafter, the owner can use power points stored in the crystal to manifest powers she knows.

The maximum number of points a _cognizance crystal_ can store is always an odd number and is never more than 17. It can store only as many power points as its original maximum, set at the time of its creation. When a _cognizance crystal's_ power points are used up, the glow of the crystal dims. However, the user can recharge it by paying power points on a 1-for-1 basis. While doing this depletes the user's own power point reserve for the day, those power points remain available in the _cognizance crystal_ until used.

A user cannot directly replenish her personal power points from those stored in a _cognizance crystal,_ nor can she draw power points from more than one source to manifest a power. See Using Stored Power Points for more information.
