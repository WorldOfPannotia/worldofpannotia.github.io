Magic items sometimes have intelligence of their own. Magically imbued with sentience, these items think and feel the same way characters do and should be treated as NPCs. Intelligent items have extra abilities and sometimes extraordinary powers and special purposes. Only permanent magic items (as opposed to single-use items or those with charges) can be intelligent. (This means that potions, scrolls, and wands, among other items, are never intelligent.) In general, less than 1% of magic items have intelligence.

Intelligent items can actually be considered creatures because they have Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. Treat them as constructs. Intelligent items often have the ability to illuminate their surroundings at will (as magic weapons do); many cannot see otherwise.

Unlike most magic items, intelligent items can activate their own powers without waiting for a command word from their owner. Intelligent items act during their owner's turn in the initiative order.

### Intelligent Item Alignment

Any item with intelligence has an alignment. Note that intelligent weapons already have alignments, either stated or by implication. If you're generating a random intelligent weapon, that weapon's alignment must fit with any alignment-oriented special abilities it has.

Any character whose alignment does not correspond to that of the item (except as noted by the asterisks on the table) gains one negative level if he or she so much as picks up the item. Although this negative level never results in actual level loss, it remains as long as the item is in hand and cannot be overcome in any way (including {% spell_link restoration %} spells). This negative level is cumulative with any other penalties the item might already place on inappropriate wielders. Items with Ego scores (see below) of 20 to 29 bestow two negative levels. Items with Ego scores of 30 or higher bestow three negative levels.

#### Special Purpose Items

| d% | Purpose
|-|-
| 01-20 | Defeat/slay diametrically opposed alignment<sup>1</sup>
| 21-30 | Defeat/slay arcane spellcasters (including spellcasting monsters and those that use spell-like abilities)
| 31-40 | Defeat/slay divine spellcasters (including divine entities and servitors)
| 41-50 | Defeat/slay nonspellcasters
| 51-55 | Defeat/slay a particular creature type (see the bane special ability for choices)
| 56-60 | Defeat/slay a particular race or kind of creature
| 61-70 | Defend a particular race or kind of creature
| 71-80 | Defeat/slay the servants of a specific deity
| 81-90 | Defend the servants and interests of a specific deity
| 91-95 | Defeat/slay all (other than the item and the wielder)
| 96-100 | Choose one
|===
| <sup>1</sup>The purpose of the neutral (N) version of this item is to preserve the balance by defeating/slaying powerful beings of the extreme alignments (LG, LE, CG, CE). |<
{: #item-purposes-table .table .table-bordered .table-hover .table-striped data-caption="Table: Intelligent Item Purpose" }

**Purpose:** An item's purpose must suit the type and alignment of the item and should always be treated reasonably. A purpose of "defeat/slay arcane spellcasters" doesn't mean that the sword forces the wielder to kill every wizard she sees. Nor does it mean that the sword believes it is possible to kill every wizard, sorcerer, and bard in the world. It does mean that the item hates arcane spellcasters and wants to bring the local wizard's cabal to ruin, as well as end the rule of a sorceress-queen in a nearby land. Likewise, a purpose of "defend elves" doesn't mean that if the wielder is an elf, he only wants to help himself. It means that the item wants to be used in furthering the cause of elves, stamping out their enemies and aiding their leaders. A purpose of "defeat/slay all" isn't just a matter of self-preservation. It means that the item won't rest (or let its wielder rest) until it places itself above all others.

#### Dedicated Power

A dedicated power operates only when an intelligent item is in pursuit of its special purpose. This determination is always made by the item. It should always be easy and straightforward to see how the ends justify the means. Unlike its other powers, an intelligent item can refuse to use its dedicated power even if the owner is dominant (see Items against Characters, below).

|---
| d% | Dedicated Power | Base Price Modifier
|-|-|-
| 01-06 | Item can use {% spell_link ice-storm %} | +50,000 gp
| 07-12 | Item can use {% spell_link confusion %} | +50,000 gp
| 13-17 | Item can use {% spell_link phantasmal-killer %} | +50,000 gp

### Item Ego

Ego is a measure of the total power and force of personality that an item possesses. Only after all aspects of an item have been generated can its Ego score be calculated. An item's Ego score helps determine whether the item or the character is dominant in their relationship, as detailed below.

|---
| Attribute of Item | Ego Points
|-|-
| Each +1 of item's enhancement bonus | 1
| Each +1 of bonus for special abilities | 1
| Each lesser power | 1
| Each greater power | 2
| Special purpose (and dedicated power) | 4
| Telepathic ability | 1
| Read languages ability | 1
| {% spell_link read-magic %} ability | 1
| Each +1 of Intelligence bonus | 1
| Each +1 of Wisdom bonus | 1
| Each +1 of Charisma bonus | 1
{: #item-ego-table .table .table-bordered .table-hover .table-striped data-caption="Table: Item Ego" }

#### Items Against Characters

When an item has an Ego of its own, it has a will of its own. The item is, of course, absolutely true to its alignment. If the character who possesses the item is not true to that alignment's goals or the item's special purpose, personality conflict &ndash; item against character &ndash; results. Similarly, any item with an Ego score of 20 or higher always considers itself superior to any character, and a personality conflict results if the possessor does not always agree with the item.

When a personality conflict occurs, the possessor must make a Will saving throw (DC = item's Ego). If the possessor succeeds, she is dominant. If she fails, the item is dominant. Dominance lasts for one day or until a critical situation occurs (such as a major battle, a serious threat to either the item or the character, and so on). Should an item gain dominance, it resists the character's desires and demands concessions such as any of the following.

 * Removal of associates or items whose alignment or personality is distasteful to the item.
 * The character divesting herself of all other magic items or items of a certain type.
 * Obedience from the character so the item can direct where they go for its own purposes.
 * Immediate seeking out and slaying of creatures hateful to the item.
 * Magical protections and devices to protect the item from molestation when it is not in use.
 * That the character carry the item with her on all occasions.
 * That the character relinquish the item in favor of a more suitable possessor due to alignment differences or conduct.

In extreme circumstances, the item can resort to even harsher measures, such as the following acts:

 * Force its possessor into combat.
 * Refuse to strike opponents.
 * Strike at its wielder or her associates.
 * Force its possessor to surrender to an opponent.
 * Cause itself to drop from the character's grasp.

Naturally, such actions are unlikely when harmony reigns between the character's and item's alignments or when their purposes and personalities are well matched. Even so, an item might wish to have a lesser character possess it in order to easily establish and maintain dominance over him, or a higher-level possessor so as to better accomplish its goals.

All magic items with personalities desire to play an important role in whatever activity is under way, particularly combat. Such items are rivals of each other, even if they are of the same alignment. No intelligent item wants to share its wielder with others. An intelligent item is aware of the presence of any other intelligent item within 60 feet, and most intelligent items try their best to mislead or distract their host so that she ignores or destroys the rival. Of course, alignment might change this sort of behavior.

Items with personalities are never totally controlled or silenced by the characters who possess them, even though they may never successfully control their possessors. They may be powerless to force their demands but remain undaunted and continue to air their wishes and demands.
