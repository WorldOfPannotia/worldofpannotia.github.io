<p>Artifacts are extremely powerful. Rather than merely another form of magic equipment, they are the sorts of legendary relics that whole campaigns can be based on. Each could be the center of a whole set of adventures &ndash; a quest to recover it, a fight against a opponent wielding it, a mission to cause its destruction, and so on.</p>
<p>No table has been included to randomly generate specific artifacts, since these items should only enter a campaign through deliberate choice on your part.</p>

<h3 id="minor">Minor Artifacts</h3>
<p>Minor artifacts are not necessarily unique items. Even so, they are magic items that no longer can be created, at least by common mortal means.</p>

<h4 id="minor-descriptions">Minor Artifact Descriptions</h4>
<p>Described below is a selection of the most well-known (not necessarily the most numerous) minor artifacts.</p>
<p id="blade-of-despair-and-hope"><strong>Blade of Despair and Hope:</strong> This +5 keen longsword is made of adamantine with a mithril pommel. When bathed for 8 hours in continuous sunlight (only natural sunlight will do; magical effects such as the daylight spell are not sufficient), it gains the holy special quality as well. If the sword is instead bathed for 8 hours in continuous moonlight, it gains the unholy special quality. While the blade is considered holy, allowing direct moonlight to touch the blade immediately dispels the holy quality. Similarly, if the blade is imbued with the unholy quality, direct sunlight will dispel it.</p>
<p id="book-of-infinite-spells"><strong>Book of Infinite Spells:</strong> This work bestows upon any character of any class the ability to use the spells within its pages. However, any character not already able to use spells gains one negative level for as long as the book is in her possession or while she uses its power. A <em>book of infinite spells</em> contains 1d8+22 pages. The nature of each page is determined by a dice roll: 01–50, arcane spell; 51–100, divine spell.</p>
<p>Determine the exact spell by using the tables for determining major scroll spells.</p>
<p>Once a page is turned, it can never be flipped back &ndash; paging through a <em>book of infinite spells</em> is a one-way trip. If the book is closed, it always opens again to the page it was on before the book was closed. When the last page is turned, the book vanishes.</p>
<p>Once per day the owner of the book can cast the spell to which the book is opened. If that spell happens to be one that is on the character's class spell list, she can cast it up to four times per day. The pages cannot be ripped out without destroying the book. Similarly, the spells cannot be cast as scroll spells, nor can they be copied into a spellbook &ndash; their magic is bound up permanently within the book itself.</p>
<p>The owner of the book need not have the book on her person in order to use its power. The book can be stored in a place of safety while the owner is adventuring and still allow its owner to cast spells by means of its power.</p>
<p>Each time a spell is cast, there is a chance that the energy connected with its use causes the page to magically turn despite all precautions. The owner knows this and may even benefit from the turning by gaining access to a new spell. The chance of a page turning depends on the spell the page contains and what sort of spellcaster the owner is.</p>

<p id="deck-of-many-things"><strong>Deck of Many Things:</strong> A <em>deck of many things</em> (both beneficial and baneful) is usually found in a box or leather pouch. Each deck contains a number of cards or plaques made of ivory or vellum. Each is engraved with glyphs, characters, and sigils. As soon as one of these cards is drawn from the pack, its magic is bestowed upon the person who drew it, for better or worse.</p>
<p>The character with a <em>deck of many things</em> who wishes to draw a card must announce how many cards she will draw before she begins. Cards must be drawn within 1 hour of each other, and a character can never again draw from this deck any more cards than she has announced. If the character does not willingly draw her allotted number (or if she is somehow prevented from doing so), the cards flip out of the deck on their own. <em>Exception:</em> If the jester is drawn, the possessor of the deck may elect to draw two additional cards.</p>
<p>Each time a card is taken from the deck, it is replaced (making it possible to draw the same card twice) unless the draw is the jester or the fool, in which case the card is discarded from the pack. A <em>deck of many things</em> contains 22 cards. To simulate the magic cards, you may want to use tarot cards, as indicated in the second column of the accompanying table. If no tarot deck is available, substitute ordinary playing cards instead, as indicated in the third column. The effects of each card, summarized on the table, are fully described below.</p>

</table>
<p><em>Balance:</em> The character must change to a radically different alignment. If the character fails to act according to the new alignment, she gains a negative level.</p>
<p><em>Comet:</em> The character must single-handedly defeat the next hostile monster or monsters encountered, or the benefit is lost. If successful, the character gains enough XP to attain the next experience level.</p>
<p><em>Donjon:</em> This card signifies imprisonment &ndash; either by the <em>imprisonment</em> spell or by some powerful being. All gear and spells are stripped from the victim in any case. Draw no more cards.</p>
<p><em>Euryale:</em> The medusalike visage of this card brings a curse that only the fates card or a deity can remove. The –1 penalty on all saving throws is otherwise permanent.</p>
<p><em>Fates:</em> This card enables the character to avoid even an instantaneous occurrence if so desired, for the fabric of reality is unraveled and respun. Note that it does not enable something to happen. It can only stop something from happening or reverse a past occurrence. The reversal is only for the character who drew the card; other party members may have to endure the situation.</p>
<p><em>Flames:</em> Hot anger, jealousy, and envy are but a few of the possible motivational forces for the enmity. The enmity of the outsider can't be ended until one of the parties has been slain. Determine the outsider randomly, and assume that it attacks the character (or plagues her life in some way) within 1d20 days.</p>
<p><em>Fool:</em> The payment of XP and the redraw are mandatory. This card is always discarded when drawn, unlike all others except the jester.</p>
<p><em>Gem:</em> This card indicates wealth. The jewelry is all gold set with gems, each piece worth 2,000 gp, the gems 1,000 gp value each.</p>
<p><em>Idiot:</em> This card causes the drain of 1d4+1 points of Intelligence immediately. The additional draw is optional.</p>
<p><em>Jester:</em> This card is always discarded when drawn, unlike all others except the fool. The redraws are optional.</p>
<p><em>Key:</em> The magic weapon granted must be one usable by the character. It suddenly appears out of nowhere in the character's hand.</p>
<p><em>Knight:</em> The fighter appears out of nowhere and serves loyally until death. He or she is of the same race (or kind) and gender as the character.</p>
<p><em>Moon:</em> This card sometimes bears the image of a moonstone gem with the appropriate number of <em>wishes</em> shown as gleams therein; sometimes it depicts a moon with its phase indicating the number of <em>wishes</em> (full = four; gibbous = three; half = two; quarter = one). These <em>wishes</em> are the same as those granted by the 9th-level wizard spell and must be used within a number of minutes equal to the number received.</p>
<p><em>Rogue:</em> When this card is drawn, one of the character's NPC friends (preferably a cohort) is totally alienated and forever after hostile. If the character has no cohorts, the enmity of some powerful personage (or community, or religious order) can be substituted. The hatred is secret until the time is ripe for it to be revealed with devastating effect.</p>
<p><em>Ruin:</em> As implied by its name, when this card is drawn, all nonmagical possessions of the drawer are lost.</p>
<p><em>Skull:</em> A dread wraith appears. Treat this creature as an unturnable undead. The character must fight it alone &ndash; if others help, they get dread wraiths to fight as well. If the character is slain, she is slain forever and cannot be revived, even with a <em>wish</em> or a <em>miracle</em>.</p>
<p><em>Star:</em> The 2 points are added to any ability the character chooses. They cannot be divided among two abilities.</p>
<p><em>Sun:</em> Roll for a medium wondrous item until a useful item is indicated.</p>
<p><em>Talons:</em> When this card is drawn, every magic item owned or possessed by the character is instantly and irrevocably gone.</p>
<p><em>Throne:</em> The character becomes a true leader in people's eyes. The castle gained appears in any open area she wishes (but the decision where to place it must be made within 1 hour).</p>
<p><em>Vizier:</em> This card empowers the character drawing it with the one-time ability to call upon a source of wisdom to solve any single problem or answer fully any question upon her request. The query or request must be made within one year. Whether the information gained can be successfully acted upon is another question entirely.</p>
<p><em>The Void:</em> This black card spells instant disaster. The character's body continues to function, as though comatose, but her psyche is trapped in a prison somewhere &ndash; in an object on a far plane or planet, possibly in the possession of an outsider. A <em>wish</em> or a <em>miracle</em> does not bring the character back, instead merely revealing the plane of entrapment. Draw no more cards.</p>

<p id="everfull-purse"><strong>Everfull Purse:</strong> This leather belt pouch has the power to turn a single gold coin into many overnight. If a single gold piece is placed in the <em>everfull purse</em> at sunset, it will be replaced at sunrise by 25 gold pieces. The <em>purse</em> has no effect if more than one gold piece is left within, or if anything other than gold is placed within.</p>

<p id="hammer-of-thunderbolts"><strong>Hammer of Thunderbolts:</strong> This <em>+3 Large returning warhammer</em> deals 4d6 points of damage on any hit. Further, if the wielder wears a <em>belt of giant Strength</em> and <em>gauntlets of ogre power</em> and he knows that the hammer is a <em>hammer of thunderbolts</em> (not just a <em>+3 warhammer</em>), the weapon can be used to full effect: It gains a total +5 enhancement bonus, allows all <em>belt</em> and <em>gauntlet</em> bonuses to stack (only when using this weapon), and strikes dead any giant upon whom it scores a hit (Fortitude DC 20 negates the death effect but not the damage).</p>
<p>When hurled, on a successful attack the hammer emits a great noise, like a clap of thunder, causing all creatures within 90 feet to be stunned for 1 round (Fortitude DC 15 negates). The hammer's range increment is 30 feet.</p>

<p id="libram-of-gainful-conjuration"><strong>Libram of Gainful Conjuration:</strong> This mystic book is of great value to arcane spellcasters of good alignment (LG, NG, CG). Study of the work requires one week. Upon completion, the good arcane caster gains a +1 inherent bonus to the ability score controlling his or her arcane spellcasting ability and experience points sufficient to place him or her halfway into the next level of experience. (If the reader has levels in more than one arcane spellcasting class, he or she must choose one of the classes to be affected.) Nongood arcane spellcasters (LN, N, CN, LE, NE, or CE) are permanently drained of 1d4+1 points of Constitution and must atone (see the <em>atonement</em> spell) in order to gain any further experience. Anyone incapable of casting arcane spells who reads even a single word of the work must make a Will save (DC 20) or suffer insanity (see the <em>insanity</em> spell). Except as indicated above, the writing in a <em>libram of gainful conjuration</em> can't be distinguished from any other book, libram, tome, or so on until perused. Once read, the book vanishes, never to be seen again, nor can the same character ever benefit from reading a similar tome a second time.</p>

<p id="libram-of-ineffable-damnation"><strong>Libram of Ineffable Damnation:</strong> This mystic book is of great value to arcane spellcasters of evil alignment (LE, NE, CE). Study of the work requires one week. Upon completion, the evil arcane caster gains a +1 inherent bonus to the ability score controlling his or her arcane spell-casting ability and experience points sufficient to place him or her halfway into the next level of experience. (If the reader has levels in more than one arcane spellcasting class, he or she must choose one of the classes to be affected.) Nonevil arcane spellcasters (LN, N, CN, LG, NG, or CG) are permanently drained of 1d4+1 points of Constitution and must atone (see the <em>atonement</em> spell) in order to gain any further experience.

<p id="libram-of-silver-magic"><strong>Libram of Silver Magic:</strong> This mystic book is of great value to arcane spellcasters of neutral alignment (LN, N, CN). Study of the work requires one week. Upon completion, the neutral arcane caster gains a +1 inherent bonus to the ability score controlling his or her arcane spellcasting ability and experience points sufficient to place him or her halfway into the next level of experience. (If the reader has levels in more than one arcane spellcasting class, he or she must choose one of the classes to be affected.) Evil or good arcane spellcasters (LE, NE, CE, LG, NG, or CG) are permanently drained of 1d4+1 points of Constitution and must atone (see the <em>atonement</em> spell) in order to gain any further experience. Anyone incapable of casting arcane spells who reads even a single word of the work must make a Will save (DC 20) or suffer insanity (see the <em>insanity</em> spell). Except as indicated above, the writing in a <em>libram of silver magic</em> can't be distinguished from any other book, libram, tome, or so on until perused.

<p id="manual-of-puissant-skill-at-arms"><strong>Manual of Puissant Skill at Arms:</strong> This treatise contains expert advice and instruction in the arts of combat. Any barbarian, fighter, monk, paladin, or ranger who spends one week studying the manual gains a +1 inherent bonus to Strength and experience points sufficient to place him or her halfway into the next level of experience. (If the reader has levels in more than one of the classes listed, he or she must choose one of the classes to be affected.) A character without any levels in one of the classes listed gains no bonus from the work, but if an arcane spellcaster without levels in one of the classes listed scans even a single word he or she will lose 2dx1,000 XP and must make a Will save (DC 20) or have 1 point of Intelligence permanently drained. Except as indicated above, the writing in a <em>manual of puissant skill at arms</em> can't be distinguished from any other book, libram, tome, or so on until perused. Once read, the book vanishes, never to be seen again, nor can the same character ever benefit from reading a similar tome a second time.</p>
<p><em>Caster Level:</em> 19th; <em>Weight:</em> 3 lb.</p>
<p id="manual-of-stealthy-pilfering"><strong>Manual of Stealthy Pilfering:</strong> This guide to thievery grants any rogue who spends a week studying its lessons a +1 inherent bonus to Dexterity and experience points sufficient to place him or her halfway into the next level of experience. A character without any rogue levels gains no bonus from the work, but if a divine spellcaster without rogue levels scans even a single word she will lose 2dx1,000 XP and must make a Will save (DC 20) or have 1 point of Wisdom permanently drained. Except as indicated above, the writing in a <em>manual of stealthy pilfering</em> can't be distinguished from any other book, libram, tome, or so on until perused. Once read, the book vanishes, never to be seen again, nor can the same character ever benefit from reading a similar tome a second time.</p>
<p><em>Caster Level:</em> 19th; <em>Weight:</em> 3 lb.</p>
<p id="philosophers-stone"><strong>Philosopher's Stone:</strong> This rare substance appears to be an ordinary, sooty piece of blackish rock. If the stone is broken open (break DC 20), a cavity is revealed at the stone's heart. This cavity is lined with a magical type of quicksilver that enables any arcane spellcaster to transmute base metals (iron and lead) into silver and gold. A single <em>philosopher's stone</em> can turn from up to 5,000 pounds of iron into silver, or up to 1,000 pounds of lead into gold. However, the quicksilver becomes unstable once the stone is opened and loses its potency within 24 hours, so all transmutations must take place within that period.</p>
<p>The quicksilver found in the center of the stone may also be put to another use. If mixed with any <em>cure</em> potion while the substance is still potent, it creates a special <em>oil of life</em> that acts as a <em>true resurrection</em> spell for any dead body it is sprinkled upon.</p>
<p>Strong transmutation; CL 20th; Weight 3 lb.</p>
<p id="rogues-dice"><strong>Rogue's Dice:</strong> This pair of cubes appears much like any other pair of typical (6-sided) dice. A character with a pair of <em>rogue's dice</em> who wishes to roll them must announce that he or she is rolling the dice (accidental rolls have no effect). Rolling the dice is a standard action, and both dice must be rolled simultaneously to have any effect. The player should roll 2d6 and consult the table below to determine the <em>dice's</em> affects.</p>

<p>No character can gain any effect from an additional roll of the dice within 24 hours, with two exceptions. If a 2 is rolled, the dice automatically roll themselves at the beginning of the character's next turn and he or she must accept the additional result. If a 12 is rolled, the character may choose to roll again in the next round (if more than 1 full round elapses between the roll of 12 and this bonus roll, the character loses the bonus roll). There is no method (mundane or magical) to predict or influence the result of a roll of <em>Rogue's dice</em>. Even powerful divination magic can't predict the outcome of a roll before it is made.</p>
<p><em>Caster Level:</em> 20th; <em>Weight:</em> &ndash;.</p>
<p id="sphere-of-annihilation"><strong>Sphere of Annihilation:</strong> A <em>sphere of annihilation</em> is a globe of absolute blackness, a ball of nothingness 2 feet in diameter. The object is actually a hole in the continuity of the multiverse. Any matter that comes in contact with a sphere is instantly sucked into the void, gone, and utterly destroyed. Only the direct intervention of a deity can restore an annihilated character.</p>
<p>A <em>sphere of annihilation</em> is static, resting in some spot as if it were a normal hole. It can be caused to move, however, by mental effort (think of this as a mundane form of telekinesis, too weak to move actual objects but a force to which the sphere, being weightless, is sensitive). A character's ability to gain control of a <em>sphere of annihilation</em> (or to keep controlling one) is based on the result of a control check against DC 30 (a move action). A control check is 1d20 + character level + character Int modifier. If the check succeeds, the character can move the sphere (perhaps to bring it into contact with an enemy) as a free action.</p>
<p>Control of a sphere can be established from as far away as 40 feet (the character need not approach too closely). Once control is established, it must be maintained by continuing to make control checks (all DC 30) each round. For as long as a character maintains control (does not fail a check) in subsequent rounds, he can control the sphere from a distance of 40 feet + 10 feet per character level. The sphere's speed in a round is 10 feet +5 feet for every 5 points by which the character's control check result in that round exceeded 30.</p>
<p>If a control check fails, the sphere slides 10 feet in the direction of the character attempting to move it.</p>
<p>If two or more creatures vie for control of a <em>sphere of annihilation</em>, the rolls are opposed. If none are successful, the sphere slips toward the one who rolled lowest.</p>
<p>Should a <em>gate</em> spell be cast upon a <em>sphere of annihilation</em>, there is a 50% chance (01–50 on d%) that the spell destroys it, a 35% chance (51–85) that the spell does nothing, and a 15% chance (86–100) that a gap is torn in the spatial fabric, catapulting everything within a 180-foot radius into another plane. If a <em>rod of cancellation</em> touches a <em>sphere of annihilation</em>, they negate each other in a tremendous explosion. Everything within a 60-foot radius takes 2d6x10 points of damage. <em>Dispel</em> <em>magic</em> and <em>mage's disjunction</em> have no effect on a sphere.</p>

<p id="staff-of-the-magi"><strong>Staff of the Magi:</strong> A long wooden staff, shod in iron and inscribed with sigils and runes of all types, this potent artifact contains many spell powers and other functions. Some of its powers use charges, while others don't. The following powers do not use charges:</p>
<ul>
    <li><em>Detect magic</em></li>
    <li><em>Enlarge person</em> (Fortitude DC 15 negates)</li>
    <li><em>Hold portal</em></li>
    <li><em>Light</em></li>
    <li><em>Mage armor</em></li>
    <li><em>Mage hand</em></li>
</ul>
<p>The following powers drain 1 charge per usage:</p>
<ul>
    <li><em>Dispel magic</em></li>
    <li><em>Fireball</em> (10d6 damage, Reflex DC 17 half )</li>
    <li><em>Ice storm</em></li>
    <li><em>Invisibility</em></li>
    <li><em>Knock</em></li>
    <li><em>Lightning bolt</em> (10d6 damage, Reflex DC 17 half )</li>
    <li><em>Passwall</em></li>
    <li><em>Pyrotechnics</em> (Will or Fortitude DC 16 negates)</li>
    <li><em>Wall of fire</em></li>
    <li><em>Web</em></li>
</ul>
<p>These powers drain 2 charges per usage:</p>
<ul>
    <li><em>Monster summoning IX</em></li>
    <li><em>Plane shift</em> (Will DC 21 negates)</li>
    <li><em>Telekinesis</em> (400 lb. maximum weight; Will DC 19 negates)</li>
</ul>
<p>A <em>staff of the magi</em> gives the wielder spell resistance 23. If this is willingly lowered, however, the staff can also be used to absorb arcane spell energy directed at its wielder, as a <em>rod of absorption</em> does. Unlike the rod, this staff converts spell levels into charges rather than retaining them as spell energy usable by a spellcaster. If the staff absorbs enough spell levels to exceed its limit of 50 charges, it explodes as if a retributive strike had been performed (see below). The wielder has no idea how many spell levels are cast at her, for the staff does not communicate this knowledge as a <em>rod of absorption</em> does. (Thus, absorbing spells can be risky.)</p>
<p><em>Retributive Strike:</em> A <em>staff of the magi</em> can be broken for a retributive strike. Such an act must be purposeful and declared by the wielder. All charges in the staff are released in a 30-foot spread. All within 10 feet of the broken staff take hit points of damage equal to 8 times the number of charges in the staff, those between 11 feet and 20 feet away take points equal to 6 times the number of charges, and those 21 feet to 30 feet distant take 4 times the number of charges. A DC 17 Reflex save reduces damage by half.</p>
<p>The character breaking the staff has a 50% chance (01–50 on d%) of traveling to another plane of existence, but if she does not (51–100), the explosive release of spell energy destroys her.

<p id="sutra-of-tranquil-thought"><strong>Sutra of Tranquil Thought:</strong> This monastic tome describes ancient techniques of mental focus and is highly prized by psionic practitioners. If a psionic character who is not evil studies the work during one week of solitary contemplation, he gains 17 bonus power points and experience points sufficient to place him halfway into the next level of experience. Those who use their powers for evil are punished for their impertinence, losing 5d6 x 1,000 XP for defiling the book. In addition, an evil reader must make an immediate DC 15 Will save or become permanently <em>confused</em> as if affected by the <em>insanity</em> power. Only <em>psychic chirurgery</em> or similarly extreme measures can restore sanity.</p>
<p>The minds of nonpsionic beings are too clouded to benefit from the secrets of this book. To anyone without psionic aptitude, the book's pages appear to contain nothing but elaborate patterns and drawings of mysterious beings. Once it is read, the book vanishes into the Astral Plane to an unknown destination. Even if it is found again, the same character cannot benefit twice from perusing its contents.</p>

<p id="talisman-of-pure-good"><strong>Talisman of Pure Good:</strong> A good (LG, NG, CG) divine spellcaster who possesses this item can cause a flaming crack to open at the feet of an evil (LE, NE, CE) divine spellcaster who is up to 100 feet away. The intended victim is swallowed up forever and sent hurtling to the center of the earth. The wielder of the talisman must be good, and if he is not exceptionally pure in thought and deed the evil character gains a DC 19 Reflex saving throw to leap away from the crack. Obviously, the target must be standing on solid ground for this item to function.</p>
<p>A <em>talisman of pure good</em> has 6 charges. If a neutral (LN, N, CN) divine spellcaster touches one of these stones, he takes 6d6 points of damage. If an evil divine spellcaster touches one, he takes 8d6 points of damage. All other characters are unaffected by the device.</p>
<p>Strong evocation [good]; CL 18th.</p>
<p id="talisman-of-the-sphere"><strong>Talisman of the Sphere:</strong> This small adamantine loop and handle are useless to those unable to cast arcane spells. Characters who cannot cast arcane spells take 5d6 points of damage merely from picking up and holding a talisman of this sort. However, when held by an arcane spellcaster who is concentrating on control of a <em>sphere of annihilation</em>, a <em>talisman of the sphere</em> doubles the character's modifier on his control check (doubling both his Intelligence bonus and his character level for this purpose).</p>
<p>If the wielder of a talisman establishes control, he need check for maintaining control only every other round thereafter. If control is not established, the sphere moves toward him. Note that while many spells and effects of cancellation have no effect upon a <em>sphere of annihilation</em>, the talisman's power of control can be suppressed or canceled.</p>
<p>Strong transmutation; CL 16th; Weight 1 lb.</p>
<p id="talisman-of-reluctant-wishes"><strong>Talisman of Reluctant Wishes:</strong> A talisman of this sort appears the same as a <em>stone of controlling earth elementals</em>. Its powers are quite different, however, and dependent on the Charisma of the individual holding the talisman. Whenever a character touches a <em>talisman of reluctant wishes</em>, he must make a DC 15 Charisma check.</p>
<p>If he fails, the device acts as a <em>stone of weight</em>. Discarding or destroying it results in 5d6 points of damage to the character and the disappearance of the talisman.</p>
<p>If he succeeds, the talisman remains with the character for 5d6 hours, or until a <em>wish</em> is made with it, whichever comes first. It then disappears.</p>
<p>If he rolls a natural 20, the character finds it impossible to be rid of the talisman for as many months as he has points of Charisma. In addition, the artifact grants him one <em>wish</em> for every 6 points of the character's Charisma. It also grows warm and throbs whenever its possessor comes within 20 feet of a mechanical or magic trap. (If the talisman is not held, its warning heat and pulses are of no avail.)</p>
<p>Regardless of which reaction results, a <em>talisman of reluctant wishes</em> disappears when its time period expires, leaving behind a 10,000 gp diamond in its stead.</p>

The intended victim is swallowed up forever and sent hurtling to the center of the earth. The wielder of the talisman must be evil, and if she is not exceptionally foul and perverse in the sights of her evil deity the good character gains a DC 19 Reflex save to leap away from the crack. Obviously, the target must be standing on solid ground for this item to function.</p>
<p>A <em>talisman of ultimate evil</em> has 6 charges. If a neutral (LN, N, CN) divine spellcaster touches one of these stones, she takes 6d6 points of damage. If a good divine spellcaster touches one, she takes 8d6 points of damage. All other characters are unaffected by the device.</p>

<h3 id="major">Major Artifacts</h3>
<p>Major artifacts are unique items &ndash; only one of each such item exists. These are the most potent of magic items, capable of altering the balance of a campaign.</p>
<p>Unlike all other magic items, major artifacts are not easily destroyed. Each should have only a single, specific means of destruction.</p>

<h4 id="major-descriptions">Major Artifact Descriptions</h4>
<p id="annulus"><strong>Annulus:</strong> This artifact is the ultimate psionic nullifier. Forged to keep enemies of vast psionic power at bay, the <em>Annulus</em> is an artifact that any psionic being should fear. It has been forgotten in the modern age, and merely finding it would precipitate a great upheaval across the planes.</p>
<p>The <em>Annulus</em> is a 1-foot-diameter ring of silvery material. Tiny slots, antennae, spheres, and other intricate projections decorate the exterior of the hoop; however, two smoothed lengths of the ring provide an adequate surface for grasping the item.</p>
<p>The <em>Annulus</em> has several powers, all of which require a wielder to tightly grasp the ring with at least one hand. When it is first grasped, knowledge of the artifact's powers immediately flood the wielder's mind. The wielder can access all powers of the <em>Annulus</em> at manifester level 20th.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The <em>Annulus</em> generates a continuous <em>catapsi</em> effect within a 100-foot-radius of the wielder (who is unaffected).</li>
    <li>The wielder gains a +4 enhancement bonus on any attempt to resist an effect that deals ability damage.</li>
    <li>Once per day, the wielder can trigger <em>ultrablast</em> as a standard action.</li>
    <li>Three times per day, as a standard action, the wielder can trigger an effect similar to <em>psionic dimensional anchor</em> that affects all creatures in a 50-foot radius.</li>
</ul>
<p>The primary power of the <em>Annulus</em>, however, is psionic nullification. Once per year, the wielder can trigger this effect as a special action requiring 10 rounds of continuous concentration to complete. The wielder specifies a target or targets within a 100-foot radius, ranging from a specific psionic individual or item to a group of psionic beings that share the same philosophy. The nullification effect is accompanied by blasts of light, heat, and sound from the <em>Annulus</em>. Nonpsionic creatures and items are unaffected, as are nontargeted beings, but any psionic target &ndash; regardless of any protection it may possess &ndash; disintegrates in a terrific explosion. Nothing is left but floating dust.</p>
<p>It is relatively easy to nullify a single target or a small group of targets, but nullifying a more powerful being (such as a demigod or greater entity) or another major artifact taxes the <em>Annulus</em> to its limits. If it is used to nullify such a target, the artifact succeeds but is destroyed in the process and cannot be retrieved by any means.</p>
<p id="armor-of-perfection"><strong>Armor of Perfection:</strong> The Armor of Perfection is made of star metal and comes in six pieces.</p>
<p><em>Belt of Perfect Strength:</em> This belt confers a +6 enhancement bonus to strength and a -4 penalty to dexterity. When worn with all five other pieces of the Armor of Perfection, the enhancement bonus becomes +12 and the penalty is removed.</p>

<p><em>Breastplate of Perfect Health:</em> This +5 breastplate confers a +6 enhancement bonus to constitution and a -4 penalty to intelligence. When worn with all five other pieces of the Armor of Perfection, the enhancement bonus becomes +12 and the penalty is removed.</p>
<p><em>Headband of Perfect Intellect:</em> This headband confers a +6 enhancement bonus to intelligence and a -4 penalty to wisdom. When worn with all five other pieces of the Armor of Perfection, the enhancement bonus becomes +12 and the penalty is removed.</p>
<p><em>Periapt of Perfect Wisdom:</em> This periapt confers a +6 enhancement bonus to wisdom and a -4 penalty to charisma. When worn with all five other pieces of the Armor of Perfection, the enhancement bonus becomes +12 and the penalty is removed.</p>
<p><em>Cloak of Perfect Charisma:</em> This cloak confers a +6 enhancement bonus to charisma and a -4 penalty to strength. When worn with all five other pieces of the Armor of Perfection, the enhancement bonus becomes +12 and the penalty is removed.</p>
<p id="armor-of-sin"><strong>Armor of Sin:</strong> The Armor of Sin is made of adamantine and comes in seven pieces. If all seven pieces are worn, the wearer takes none of the penalties incurred, but retains all bonuses and also gains the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Smite good 3/day - treat the wearer as being +15 HD for the purpose of determining the bonus damage dealt.</li>
	<li>Damage reduction 50 / epic and holy</li>
	<li>When wearing all seven pieces of the Armor of Sin, the wearer is considered to be wearing full plate instead of breastplate, as noted in the description of the Breastplate of Gluttony.</li>
</ul>
<p>The seven pieces of the Armor of Sin are as follows:</p>
<p><em>Helmet of Envy</em></p>
<p>Benefit: The wearer of this helmet is able to channel his envy with devastating results. Twice per day, he can add his intimidate modifier as a luck bonus to a single attack roll and damage. If the attack is still a miss, the bonus damage is considered to be wasted and the attempt is still used. When worn with all six other pieces of the Armor of Sin, this ability can be used five times per day.</p>
<p>Penalty: Whenever the wearer of this helmet is within 10ft. of another creature possessing a similar, but higher quality, item to anything the wearer possesses, he must make a will save DC 20 or attack the other creature in an attempt to aquire the higher quality item.</p>
<p><em>Medallion of Lust</em></p>
<p>Benefit: The wearer of this medallion can use the spell charm person at will with a save DC of 11 + cha modifier. If worn with all six other pieces of the Armor of Sin, the save DC becomes 21 + cha modifier.</p>
<p>Penalty: Whenever the wearer is within 30ft. of a member of the opposing gender of their race (or another creature the wearer would find physically attractive), the wearer must succeed on a Will save DC 25 + cha modifier of the person (or creature) in question. Failure on this save means the wearer is considered fascinated until he/she is able to make, and pass, another save attempt. If the wearer passes a save, he/she does not need to make a save to be fascinated by the same creature for 24 hours.</p>
<p><em>Bracers of Wrath</em></p>
<p>Benefit: These bracers allow the wearer to rage as a 10th-level barbarian a number of times per day equal to 1 + Cha modifier (minimum 1/day). When worn with all six other pieces of the Armor of Sin, the rage functions as a 20th-level barbarian.</p>
<p>Penalty: The wearer takes a -5 penalty to Reflex and Will saves as a result of their blinding rage.</p>
<p><em>Breastplate of Gluttony</em></p>
<p>Benefit: This breastplate has a +4 enhancement bonus, has the light fortification ability, and shields the wearer in a constant unholy ward effect. When worn with all six other pieces of the Armor of Sin, the enhancement bonus increases to +5, light fortification becomes moderate fortification, and the armor also gains the undead controlling ability.</p>
<p>Penalty: While wearing the breastplate, the wearer takes a -10 penalty on fortitude saving throws vs ingested poisons. In addition, the wearer must succeed a will save DC 15 whenever an enemy falls in battle (DC 20 if the wearer dealt the final blow). Failure on this save compels the wearer to consume a piece of his enemy's flesh in a ritualistic sacrifice. This is a full round action that provokes an attack of opportunity.</p>
<p><em>Ring of Pride</em></p>
<p>Benefit: This ring provides the wearer a +4 enhancement bonus to Charisma. When worn with all six other pieces of the Armor of Sin, this bonus increases to +8.</p>
<p>Penalty: Because of the conceited air of the character, they take a -5 penalty on diplomacy and sense motive checks when wearing the ring.</p>
<p><em>Gloves of Greed</em></p>
<p>Benefit: These gloves function as a pair of Gloves of Storing, except that they are capable of storing objects up to 50lbs. each. When worn with all six other pieces of the Armor of Sin, the maximum weight of the objects is 75lb. per glove.</p>
<p>Penalty: Whenever the wearer comes within 5ft. of a valuable object (the object must be able to be stored in one of the gloves), they must make a Will save with the DC being 10 + (gp value of item / 100). A failure on this save means the wearer must attempt to steal the item. They must make a sleight of hand or dexterity check, whichever is higher, and normal rules apply.</p>
<p><em>Boots of Sloth</em></p>
<p>Benefit: When worn, these boots provide the wearer with a +5 competence bonus on balance checks, as well as a +4 bonus to opposed strength checks to avoid being tripped or bull rushed. When worn with all six other pieces of the Armor of Sin, the competence bonus to balance checks increases to +10 and the bonus to strength checks increases to +8.</p>
<p>Penalty: The wearer of these boots makes one fewer attack per round during a full attack action. This attack must be at the highest attack bonus. For example, a 16th level fighter with a strength of 18 wearing these boots would normally have an attack bonus of +20/+15/+10. Instead, this bonus becomes +15/+10 during a full attack. In addition, the wearer's speed is reduced as if he were wearing heavy armor. This effect reduces the wearer's speed, even if he has another ability (such as a dwarf's stability) that would otherwise prevent his speed from being reduced by heavy armor.</p>
<p id="armor-of-virtue"><strong>Armor of Virtue:</strong> The Armor of Virtue is made of mithril and comes in seven pieces. If all seven pieces are worn, the wearer takes none of the penalties incurred, but retains all bonuses and also gains the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Smite evil 3/day - treat the wearer as being +15 HD for the purpose of determining the bonus damage dealt.</li>
	<li>Damage reduction 50 / epic and evil</li>
	<li>When wearing all seven pieces of the Armor of Virtue, the wearer is considered to be wearing full plate instead of breastplate, as noted in the description of the Breastplate of Fortitude.</li>
</ul>
<p>The seven pieces of the Armor of Virtue are as follows:</p>
<p><em>Helmet of Prudence</em></p>
<p>Benefit: The wearer of this helmet is able to channel her foresight with amazing results. Twice per day, she can add her sense motive modifier as a luck bonus to her Armor Class for a round. Activating this ability is a free action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. When worn with all six other pieces of the Armor of Virtue, this ability can be used five times per day.</p>
<p>Penalty: Because the wearer of the Helmet of Prudence focuses not on attack, but on studying her adversary, the wearer of the helmet takes a -4 penalty on Initiative checks and a -2 penalty to attack rolls as long as the helmet is worn.</p>
<p><em>Medallion of Faith</em></p>
<p>Benefit: The wearer of this medallion gains a +6 divine bonus to Will saves to resist charms, compulsions, or mind-affecting effects. This stacks with any other racial, magical or class bonuses the wearer may have. When worn with all six other pieces of the Armor of Virtue, the wearer is instead immune to these effects.</p>
<p>Penalty: Divine intervention often does not come without some cost. As long as the medallion is worn, the wearer takes a -2 penalty to Strength and Constitution. This represents the wearer letting go of the physical world and placing faith in the divine.</p>
<p><em>Bracers of Justice</em></p>
<p>Benefit: Twice per day, the wearer of these bracers can use a mark of justice spell. This spell is cast as a 10th level cleric and has a casting time of 10 minutes. When the bracers are worn with the rest of the Armor of Virtue, the caster level is increased to 20.</p>
<p>Penalty: The wearer of these bracers is herself subject to a mark of justice spell, though only while wearing the bracers. If she commits any acts that are not lawful or good, she must succeed in a Will saving throw vs DC 30 or suffer two of the effects of a bestow curse spell (roll to determine which effects). These affects cannot be reversed except through an atonement spell.</p>
<p>Special: Even when worn with all six other pieces of the Armor of Virtue, the wearer of these bracers is still under the effect of the mark of justice spell. The wearer must at all times be vigilant of her actions.</p>
<p><em>Breastplate of Fortitude</em></p>
<p>Benefit: This breastplate has a +4 enhancement bonus and the abilities light fortification and wand bearing. When worn with all six other pieces of the Armor of Virtue, the enhancement bonus increases to +5, light fortification becomes moderate fortification, and the armor also grants the wearer immunity to death spells, magical death effects, energy drain, and negative energy effects (such as chill touch or inflict spells).</p>
<p>Penalty: The wearer of this breastplate takes a -5 penalty to reflex saves made while the armor is worn.</p>
<p><em>Ring of Hope</em></p>
<p>Benefit: This ring provides the wearer a +2 enhancement bonus to Charisma as well as a +4 bonus to saves vs fear affects. When worn with all six other pieces of the Armor of Virtue, the Charisma bonus increases to +6 and the save bonus to +8.</p>
<p>Penalty: The wearer of this ring is hopeful to a fault. She takes a -5 penalty on diplomacy and sense motive checks when wearing the ring because of her belief that there must be some good in all creatures.</p>
<p><em>Gloves of Self Sacrifice</em></p>
<p>Benefit: The wearer of these gloves is quick in action and virtuous in deed. She gains a +6 bonus to Dexterity. When worn with all six other pieces of the Armor of Virtue, the bonus increases to +10.</p>
<p>Penalty: The wearer of these gloves must be willing to pay the ultimate price for the good of others. Whenever she is in a position to save another creature from injury or death (except in the case of direct combat with an evil creature), she must succeed on a Will saving throw DC 30 or spring to the aid of the individual in danger.</p>
<p><em>Boots of Temperance</em></p>
<p>Benefit: The wearer of these boots is capable of showing remarkable restraint. She gains a +4 bonus to Will saves to resist compulsion or charm effects, a +4 bonus to opposed strength checks to avoid being tripped or bull rushed, and she is able to deal subdual damage instead of lethal with any attack she makes. When worn with all six other pieces of the Armor of Virtue, the bonuses increase to +8.</p>
<p>Penalty: The wearer of these boots sacrifices a single attack during her full round attack option. This attack is at the highest attack bonus. For example, a 16th level paladin with a strength of 18 wearing these boots would normally have an attack bonus of +20/+15/+10. Instead, this bonus becomes +15/+10 during a full attack.</p>
<p id="axe-of-the-dwarvish-lords"><strong>Axe of the Dwarvish Lords:</strong> This is a <em>+6 keen throwing goblinoid bane dwarven waraxe</em>. Any dwarf who holds it doubles the range of his or her darkvision. Any nondwarf who grasps the <em>Axe</em> takes 2 points of temporary Charisma damage; these points cannot be healed or restored in any way while the <em>Axe</em> is held. The current owner of the <em>Axe</em> gains a +10 bonus on Craft (armorsmithing, blacksmithing, gemcutting, stonemasonry, and weaponsmithing) checks. The wielder of the <em>Axe</em> can summon an elder earth elemental (as <em>summon monster IX</em>; duration 20 rounds) once per week.</p>
<p id="brand-of-baelthenal"><strong>Brand of Baelthenal:</strong> This +7 <a href="#">vicious</a> <a href="#">vorpal</a> <a href="#">human dread</a> longsword is made from polished obsidian.</p>
<p id="codex-of-the-infinite-planes"><strong>Codex of the Infinite Planes:</strong> The <em>Codex</em> is enormous &ndash; supposedly, it requires two strong men to lift it. No matter how many pages are turned, another always remains. Anyone opening the <em>Codex</em> for the first time is utterly annihilated, as with a <em>destruction</em> spell (Fortitude DC 30 for only 10d6 damage). Those who survive can peruse its pages and learn its powers, though not without risk. Each day spent studying the <em>Codex</em> allows the reader to make a Spellcraft check (DC 50) to learn one of its powers (choose the power learned randomly; add a +1 circumstance bonus on the check per additional day spent reading until a power is learned). However, each day of study also forces the reader to make a Will save (DC 30 + 1 per day of study) to avoid being driven insane (as the <em>insanity</em> spell). The powers of the <em>Codex of the Infinite Planes</em> are as follows: <em>astral projection, banishment, elemental swarm, gate, greater planar ally, greater planar binding, plane shift</em>, and <em>soul bind</em>. Each is usable at will by the owner of the <em>Codex</em> (assuming that he or she has learned how to access the power). The <em>Codex of the Infinite Planes</em> has a caster level of 30th for the purposes of all powers and catastrophes, and all saving throw DCs are 20 + spell level. Activating any power requires both a Concentration check and a Spellcraft check (DC 40 + twice the spell level of the power; the character can't take 10 on this check). Any failure on either check indicates a catastrophe befalls the user (roll on the table below for the effect). A character can only incur one catastrophe per power use, even if he or she fails both checks.</p>

<p id="cup-and-talisman-of-the-demigod"><strong>Cup and Talisman of the Demigod:</strong> The <em>Cup</em> is a large gem-set golden chalice requiring two hands to lift. It emits light (as the <em>daylight</em> spell) at all times and automatically dispels any darkness-based spells whose area it enters. If the cup is filled with holy water (requiring a full gallon), that substance will act as a <em>potion of cure critical wounds</em> or a <em>potion of neutralize poison</em> (owner's choice) if drunk. This liquid can't be saved or stored in any way. The <em>Talisman</em> is a small eight-pointed platinum star hanging from a chain of gold and pearls. The wearer gains a +6 enhancement bonus to Charisma and may cast <em>remove blindness/deafness, remove curse</em>, and <em>remove disease</em> at will. Furthermore, if the <em>Talisman</em> is placed within the <em>Cup</em> and the <em>Cup</em> filled with holy water, that liquid acts as a special elixir of <em>resurrection</em> (as the spell). This effect will function only once per month. Any evil or chaotic creature that touches the <em>Cup</em> or <em>Talisman</em> is struck with a <em>holy word</em> (if evil) or <em>dictum</em> (if chaotic) spell (or both if the creature is chaotic evil).</p>
<p id="dathfunimae"><strong>Dathfunimae:</strong> This +14 <a href="#">keen</a> <a href="#">speed</a> <a href="#">fiery blast</a> <a href="#">bloodletting</a> longsword is made of star metal. The pommel is made out of ivory and is carved into the shape of a red dragon's neck and head. Inset into the eyes of the dragon head are rubies. These glow with a faint light at all times, even in complete magical darkness.</p>
<p>In addition to its regular functions, Dathfunimae has the following abilities: 3 times per day, the wielder can cast an intensified flame strike (180 fire damage) as a standard action. Also, the sword functions as a Rod of the Wyrm attuned to a red dragon, except that the dragon the sword turns into is a Great Wyrm.</p>
<p id="eye-of-the-orc"><strong>Eye of the Orc:</strong> This lump of rock has a marquis-cut black sapphire set in its center, making it appear similar to a large eye. If possessed by an orc, it grants a +6 enhancement bonus to Strength and Charisma, and the orc's darkvision range is doubled. Nonorcs who possess the <em>Eye</em> gain a +2 enhancement bonus to Strength but take a –2 penalty to Intelligence and Charisma. Regardless of the owner's race, any weapon wielded by the owner of the <em>Eye</em> is considered an <em>elf bane weapon</em>. Furthermore, by holding the <em>Eye</em> before the character, he or she can perceive things as if he or she had <em>true seeing</em> cast upon him or her. This can be activated only once per day but lasts as long as the character concentrates on it (requiring a standard action each round).</p>
<p id="golem-armor"><strong>Golem Armor:</strong> This enormous suit of black iron <em>+10 full plate armor</em> increases the wearer's size by one category (to a maximum of Colossal). The wearer gains a +10 enhancement bonus to Strength and is rendered immune to mind-affecting effects, poison, disease, and similar effects. He or she is not subject to critical hits, subdual damage, ability damage, energy drain, or death from massive damage. <em>Golem Armor</em> is immune to rust attacks. The wearer of <em>Golem Armor</em> gains damage reduction 15/adamantine. He or she also cannot regain hit points by any means (mundane or magical) while the armor is worn. It requires 1 hour to don or extract oneself from <em>Golem Armor</em>.</p>
<p id="invulnerable-coat"><strong>Invulnerable Coat:</strong> The <em>Invulnerable Coat</em> <em>+5 chain shirt of heavy fortification</em>. It grants its wearer damage reduction 10/epic and resistance 20 against acid, cold, electricity, fire, and sonic energy. If the wearer can turn undead, treat the wearer as having +4 class levels for purposes of caster level, turning undead, smiting evil, and laying on hands.</p>
<p id="iron-gauntlet-of-war"><strong>Iron Gauntlet of War:</strong> The <em>Gauntlet</em> grants a +8 enhancement bonus to Strength. The wearer doubles the damage bonus on any smite attacks he or she makes. If the wearer has the Leadership feat, the wearer's Leadership score increases by +4, but the wearer can never attract or keep followers or cohorts who are good or chaotic. Once per day, the wielder can use <em>implosion</em> as a 20th-level caster (DC 23). The <em>Iron Gauntlet of War</em> is intelligent (Int 13, Wis 18, Cha 24, Ego 26) and lawful evil. It can communicate telepathically with its wearer, though it cannot speak. It will always seek to dominate any wearer who isn't lawful evil, forcing such an owner to commit lawful evil deeds (or else find a more suitable wearer).</p>
<p id="the-moaning-diamond"><strong>The Moaning Diamond:</strong> The <em>Moaning Diamond</em> appears to be an uncut diamond the size of a human fist. At all times, it gives forth a baleful moaning sound, as if in pain. Despite the noise, the <em>Moaning Diamond</em> is not evil. The wielder of the stone can, three times per day, call upon it to reshape earth and stone as if by the spell <em>stone shape</em>, affecting 5,000 cubic feet of material. The <em>Moaning Diamond</em> can summon an elder earth elemental with maximum hit points that serves the caster until it is slain. Only one such elemental can be summoned at a time; if it is slain, a new creature cannot be summoned for 24 hours.</p>
<p id="the-orbs-of-dragonkind"><strong>The Orbs of Dragonkind:</strong> Each of these fabled orbs contains the essence and personality of an ancient dragon of a different variety (one for each of the major ten different chromatic and metallic dragons). The bearer of an <em>Orb</em> can <em>dominate</em> dragons of its particular variety within 500 feet (as <em>dominate monster</em>), the dragon being forced to make a DC 25 Will save to resist. (Spell resistance is not useful against this effect.) Each <em>Orb of Dragonkind</em> bestows upon the wielder the AC and saving throw bonuses of the dragon within. These values replace whatever values the character would otherwise have, whether they are better or worse. These values cannot be modified by any means short of ridding the character of the <em>Orb</em>. A character possessing an <em>Orb of Dragonkind</em> is immune to the breath weapon &ndash; but only the breath weapon &ndash; of the dragon variety keyed to the <em>Orb</em>. Finally, a character possessing an <em>Orb</em> can herself use the breath weapon of the dragon in the <em>Orb</em> three times per day.</p>
<p>All <em>Orbs of Dragonkind</em> can be used to communicate verbally and visually with the possessors of the other <em>Orbs</em>. The owner of an <em>Orb</em> knows whether there are dragons within 10 miles at all times. For dragons of the <em>Orb</em>'s particular variety, the range is 100 miles. If within 1 mile of a dragon of the <em>Orb</em>'s variety, the wielder can determine the exact location and age of the creature. The bearer of one of these <em>Orbs</em> earns the enmity forever of all dragonkind for profiting by the enslavement of one of their kin, even if she later loses the item.</p>
<p>Each <em>Orb</em> also has an individual power that can be invoked once per round at 10th caster level.</p>

    <li><em>Gold Dragon Orb:</em> The owner of the gold <em>Orb</em> can call upon any power possessed by one of the other <em>Orbs</em> &ndash; including the <em>dominate</em> and breath weapon abilities but not AC, save bonuses, or breath weapon immunity &ndash; but can only use an individual power once per day. She can use <em>dominate</em> on any other possessor of an <em>Orb</em> within 1 mile (Will DC 23 negates).</li>

<p id="psicrown-of-the-crystal-mind"><strong>Psicrown of the Crystal Mind:</strong> An elaborate crystalline psicrown etched with strange designs, this exceptional psicrown is so invested with power that it is considered an artifact.</p>
<p>The power points in the <em>Psicrown of the Crystal Mind</em> can be used to manifest any of the following powers at manifester level 20th (or at the wearer's manifester level if it is higher than 20th).</p>
<ul>
    <li><em>Burst</em></li>
    <li><em>Catfall</em></li>
    <li><em>Concealing amorpha, greater</em></li>
    <li><em>Concussion blast</em></li>
    <li><em>Daze, psionic</em></li>
    <li><em>Detect psionics</em></li>
    <li><em>Dominate, psionic</em></li>
    <li><em>Far hand</em></li>
    <li><em>Float</em></li>
    <li><em>Mindlink</em></li>
    <li><em>Inertial barrier</em></li>
    <li><em>Telekinetic force</em></li>
    <li><em>Telekinetic maneuver</em></li>
    <li><em>Telekinetic thrust</em></li>
    <li><em>Teleport, psionic</em></li>
    <li><em>Thicken skin</em></li>
    <li><em>True metabolism</em></li>
</ul>
<p>The wearer of the <em>Psicrown of the Crystal Mind</em> also gains power resistance equal to 10 + his manifester level.</p>
<p>The <em>Psicrown of the Crystal Mind</em> has 1,000 power points when discovered. Anyone who dons the crown instantly knows the number of power points it has at the current time. The crown recharges itself, gaining back 1 power point per day if it currently has fewer than 1,000 points.</p>
<p>As a special one-time use of the psicrown, the wearer can channel all the remaining charges in the psicrown into an uncontrolled burst of energy. The wearer triggers this use as a standard action. All within 20 feet of the wearer take hit points of damage equal to half the power points left in the staff (Reflex DC 18 half). The wearer inhabits a tiny eye of calm at the center of the destruction and is unharmed, but the psicrown is reduced to a burned-out cinder.</p>
<p id="ring-of-nine-facets"><strong>Ring of Nine Facets:</strong> This ring is set with a gem of nine facets, each one in-scribed with a different incomprehensible rune. Each day at sunrise, the gem turns to display a different facet. The active facet determines the <em>Ring's</em> power for that day. Each day, roll 1d10 to determine which facet (and thus which power) is active.</p>

<p>The wearer of the <em>Ring</em> can, with a great deal of mental exertion, attempt to change the active facet away from one he or she does not desire. This requires a full-round action and a Concentration check (DC 50), and deals 2d6 points of nonlethal damage regardless of success. If the save is successful, the new facet is determined randomly. If the <em>Ring</em> is removed, the former wearer takes 2d6 points of nonlethal damage each minute until it is replaced or until his or her nonlethal damage exceeds his or her current hit points (though the nonlethal damage resumes again immediately when the former wearer regains consciousness).</p>
<p id="the-saints-mace"><strong>The Saint's Mace:</strong> This relic appears to be a simple, well-used cudgel, but its simple appearance hides great power. The <em>saint's mace</em> has a +5 enhancement bonus and functions as a heavy mace with the holy, lawful, and disruption special abilities. The wielder can project <em>searing light</em> from the mace at will, at caster level 20th.</p>
<p id="the-shadowstaff"><strong>The Shadowstaff:</strong> This artifact was crafted centuries ago, weaving together the wispy strands of shadow itself into a twisted black staff. The <em>Shadowstaff</em> makes the wielder slightly shadowy and incorporeal, granting him a +4 bonus to AC and Reflex saves (which stacks with any other bonuses). However, in bright light (such as that of the sun, but not a torch) or in absolute darkness, the wielder takes a –2 penalty on all attack rolls, saves, and checks.</p>
<p>The <em>Shadowstaff</em> also has these powers.</p>
<ul>
    <li><em>Summon Shadows:</em> Three times per day the staff may summon 2d4 shadows. Immune to turning, they serve the wielder as if called by a <em>summon monster V</em> spell cast at 20th level.</li>
    <li><em>Summon Nightshade:</em> Once per month, the staff can summon a nightcrawler nightshade that serves the wielder as if called by a <em>summon monster IX</em> spell cast at 20th level.</li>
    <li><em>Shadow Form:</em> Three times per day the wielder can become a living shadow, with all the movement powers granted by the <em>gaseous form</em> spell.</li>
    <li><em>Shadow Bolt:</em> Three times per day the staff can project a ray attack that deals 10d6 points of cold damage to a single target. The shadow bolt has a range of 100 feet.</li>
</ul>
<p id="the-shield-of-the-sun"><strong>The Shield of the Sun:</strong> This <em>+5 large shield</em>, emblazoned with the symbol of the sun, allows the wielder to cast spells as if she were a 20th-level paladin with a Wisdom score of 20. The spells gained are cumulative with any existing spells per day that the character might have, even if she's already a paladin. The <em>Shield of the Sun</em> also grants spell resistance 15 to its wielder. It absorbs the first 10 points of damage from any energy attack (fire, cold, acid, electricity, or sonic). In return for all this, once per year the shield's owner must undertake a quest (no saving throw to avoid) at the behest of a lawful good deity.</p>
<p>A character who is evil or chaotic (LE, NE, CE, CN, CG) gains four negative levels if she attempts to use this artifact. Although these negative levels never results in actual level loss, they remain as long as the shield is in hand and cannot be overcome in any way (including <em>restoration</em> spells). The negative levels disappear when the shield is stowed or leaves the wearer's possession.</p>
