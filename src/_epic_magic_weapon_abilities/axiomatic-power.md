  description: |
    This weapon is lawful-aligned and thus bypasses the corresponding damager reduction. When a weapon of axiomatic power strikes a chaotic target, this power erupts forth and deals +{% die_roll 3 6 0 %} points of bonus lawful damage to the target, and the target gains one negative level (Fortitude DC 23 to remove 24 hours later). On a successful critical hit it instead deals +{% die_roll 6 6 0 %} points of lawful damage and bestows two negative levels (or +{% die_roll 9 6 0 %} and three negative levels if the critical multiplier is &times;3, or +{% die_roll 12 6 0 %} and four negative levels if the critical multiplier is &times;4). The weapon bestows three negative levels on any chaotic creature attempting to wield it. These negative levels remain as long as the weapon is in hand and disappear when the weapon is no longer wielded. These negative levels never result in actual level loss, but they cannot be overcome in any way (including {% spell_link restoration %} spells) while the weapon is wielded. Bows, crossbows, and slings with this special ability bestow the lawful power upon their ammunition. This special ability does not stack with the nonepic axiomatic special ability.
