    On command, an icy blast weapon is sheathed in icy cold (though this deals no damage to the wielder). On any hit, this cold washes over the creature struck, dealing+{% die_roll 3 6 0 %} points of bonus cold damage. On a successful critical hit it instead deals +{% die_roll 6 6 0 %} points of cold damage (or +{% die_roll 9 6 0 %} if the critical multiplier is &times;3, or +{% die_roll 12 6 0 %} if the critical multiplier is &times;4). Bows, crossbows, and slings with this special ability bestow the bonus cold damage upon their ammunition.
