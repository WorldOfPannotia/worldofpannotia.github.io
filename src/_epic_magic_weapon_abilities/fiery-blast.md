  description: |
    On command, a fiery blast weapon is sheathed in fire (though this deals no damage to the wielder). On any hit, this fire engulfs the creature struck, dealing +3d6 points of bonus fire damage. On a successful critical hit it instead deals +6d6 points of fire damage (or +9d6 if the critical multiplier is &times;3, or +12d6 if the critical multiplier is &times;4). Bows, crossbows, and slings with this special ability bestow the bonus fire damage upon their ammunition.
