  description: |
    On command, a sonic blast weapon emits a low thrumming hum (though this deals no damage to the wielder). On any hit, this becomes a thunderous roar that deals +3d6 points of bonus sonic damage to the creature struck. On a successful critical hit it instead deals +6d6 points of sonic damage (or +9d6 if the critical multiplier is &times;3, or +12d6 if the critical multiplier is &times;4). Bows, crossbows, and slings with this special ability bestow the bonus sonic damage upon their ammunition.
