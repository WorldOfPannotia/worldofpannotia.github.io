  description: |
    On command, a sonic blast weapon emits a low thrumming hum (though this deals no damage to the wielder). On any hit, this becomes a thunderous roar that deals +{% die_roll 3 6 0 %} points of bonus sonic damage to the creature struck. On a successful critical hit it instead deals +{% die_roll 6 6 0 %} points of sonic damage (or +{% die_roll 9 6 0 %} if the critical multiplier is &times;3, or +{% die_roll 12 6 0 %} if the critical multiplier is &times;4). Bows, crossbows, and slings with this special ability bestow the bonus sonic damage upon their ammunition.
