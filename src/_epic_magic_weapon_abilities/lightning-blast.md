On command, a lightning blast weapon crackles with electrical energy (though this deals no damage to the wielder). On any hit, lightning coruscates around the creature struck, dealing+3d6 points of bonus electricity damage. On a successful critical hit it instead deals +6d6 points of electricity damage (or +9d6 if the critical multiplier is &times;3, or +12d6 if the critical multiplier is &times;4). Bows, crossbows, and slings with this special ability bestow the bonus electricity damage upon their ammunition.
