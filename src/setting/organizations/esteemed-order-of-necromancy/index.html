<h4>History:</h4>
<p>
    The Esteemed Order of Necromancy started long ago as a means of assisting
    the government and other businesses. At first, most people eyed them warily,
    but as their reputation grew, people learned to trust them.
</p>
<p>
    In the beginning, the Order offered several basic services: cheap manual
    labor, reliable courier services (undead don't really care what they're
    carrying), and even, in some cases, the most loyal guards and soldiers you
    could need.
</p>
<p>
    The former families of the raised undead (if they had any living relatives)
    were compensated for the use of their loved one's corpse in such an unusual
    fashion, and after a period of service, the undead were destroyed to give
    them their final rest.
</p>
<p>
    However, as time went by and the Order became more deeply involved in
    various aspects of city life, they slowly started raising the prices they
    charged for their services and the length of time they kept an individual's
    body, as well as reducing the compensation for the undead's former families.
    This happened over a long enough period that, by the time people noticed
    what was happening, it was too late to stop. The Order had their workers in
    nearly every aspect of the city's infrastructure, from general maintenance
    and construction to guard service to cheap labor for nearly any task.
</p>
<p>
    It was at that point the Order threatened the citizens with unspeakable
    horrors if they did not concede to their demands. These were simple: the
    leaders and high-ranking members of the Order were given diplomatic immunity
    to all the laws of the city, and they were also given the first opportunity
    at any new job created in any market. If the Order accepted a job, they
    charged whatever fee they wished, and if the business or individual did not
    pay or was not able to pay in a reasonable amount of time, the Order
    "recruited" them. Essentially, the Order would have the offending person
    publicly executed and raised as another of their cheap laborers.
</p>
<h4>Organization:</h4>
<p>
    The order is presided over a by powerful lich and a council of five other
    necromancers. Only those on the Order's council are aware that the leader is
    a lich. To all others, he appears as a normal, living elf.

<h4>Leader Name:</h4>

<h4>Leader Bio:</h4>
<p>
    Athauric is an elven lich who once actually possessed a kind heart. Born
    Maeglin Tur-anion, Athauric changed his name when he moved to the city in
    order to fit in better with the humans there. In the city, he founded the
    Esteemed Order of Necromancy in an effort to turn what had always been
    considered a black art and make it into something that could be beneficial
    to the average commoner. However, over the years, his heart and soul were
    corrupted by his continuous use of the Necromantic arts, and he forsook the
    pure life for the one desiring power. He became a lich, using illusory magic
    during his public appearances to hide fact that he was now one of the undead
    himself. Because of his elven heritage, his long life span has not yet
    raised suspicion with the rest of the city.
