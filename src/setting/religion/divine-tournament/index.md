To gain Divine Rank 0, a mortal must challenge a Demigod whose Divine Rank is between 1 and 5 in the tournament. This requires the mortal to be able to find a Demigod, challenge that Demigod, and have the prospective opponent accept the challenge. If the mortal wins, they are granted Divine Rank 0, and the Demigod is reduced in rank by 2. If the mortal loses, they are slain permanently, and may only be brought back to life by an intermediate or greater deity using the {% divine_ability_link gift-of-life %} ability.

Any time there is a reduction in a deity's Divine Rank, that rank cannot drop below 0. Deities cannot become mortal again.

While battling in the [Divine Arena]({{ site.url }}/setting/religion/divine-tournament/divine-arena/), the following changes are made to the standard template that each deity possesses:

 * Deities fighting in the tournament automatically fail on an attack roll or save if they roll a natural 1 on the d20
 * Along the same lines, greater deities no longer always maximize their rolls. That is, they do not automatically score a roll of 20 with their attack roll (meaning they only have to roll to hit). All deities in the tournament must roll to hit as per the normal combat rules.
 * During a battle in the [Divine Arena]({{ site.url }}/setting/religion/divine-tournament/divine-arena/), a deity loses all immunities granted by her deism, except for the following:
   * A deity is still immune to transmutation effects
   * A deity is still immune to disease, death effects, and disintegration
   * A deity is still immune to effects that banish or imprison them
 * During a battle, a deity loses some abilities granted by her deism as per the following list:
   * A deity can only perform 1 swift, immediate, or free action per round.
   * A deity's divine aura is suppressed while she is in combat in the [Divine Arena]({{ site.url }}/setting/religion/divine-tournament/divine-arena/)
