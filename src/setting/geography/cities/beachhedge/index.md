<h4>Map Location:</h4>
O19
<h4>Description</h4>
This town is the primary location for the <a href="{{ site.url }}/setting-info/organizations/esteemed-order-of-necromancy/">Esteemed Order of Necromancy</a>. There was recently a <a href="{{ site.url }}/setting-info/history/events/anglius-beachhedge-war/">war</a> between this city and <a href="{{ site.url }}/setting-info/geography/cities/anglius/">Anglius</a> over the necromantic tendencies of the city.
The majority of the population here is neutral, with some leaning towards evil tendencies. Nearly all of them are human, but some orc- and goblin-kind can be found in the dirtier parts of the city.
