<h4>Description</h4>
<p>This is the capital city in the country of the same name. It was recently torn in two by a <a href="{{ site.url }}/setting-info/history/events/bellyn-vangam-war/">bloody war</a> between those loyal to the crown and the <a href="{{ site.url }}/setting-info/organizations/five-houses-of-vangam/">Five Houses of Vangam</a>. The Five Houses seceded from <a href="{{ site.url }}/setting-info/geography/cities/bellyn/">Bellyn</a> and formed the nation of <a href="{{ site.url }}/setting-info/geography/cities/vangam/">Vangam</a>.</p>
<p>The current ruler of both the nation and city of Bellyn is a young <a href="{{ site.url }}/mosters/list/reborn/">Reborn</a> named <a href="{{ site.url }}/setting-info/npcs/ciralia-eryniome/">Ciralia Eryniome</a>, who assumed rule after the death of her father in the war. Though she is still fairly young for a queen, she has proven to be a natural leader, and the future of <a href="{{ site.url }}/setting-info/geography/cities/bellyn/">Bellyn</a> is looking bright.</p>
