<h4>Description</h4>
This is the capital of the <a href="{{ site.url }}/setting-info/geography/regions/juri-empire/">Juri Empire</a>, a small region situated in the desert. The inhabitants of this town spend their lives spreading justice and attempting to bring peace to the lawlessness that is the hot waste around them.
There is an order of paladin <a href="{{ site.url }}/monsters/list/werelion/">werelions</a> in the service of the emporer. They are the elite captains of the guard, as well as the special forces, and they answer only to the emporer.
