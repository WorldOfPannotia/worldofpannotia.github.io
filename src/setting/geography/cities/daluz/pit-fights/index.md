<h4>Ideas</h4>
This is the upshot of my current ideas:
4 "elemental" arenas, each embodying one of the four basic elements, so for example:
Air: Open room, many platforms at varying levels, with ladders and ropes etc, with mobility being the main advantage
Earth: Underground, narrow, claustrophobic spaces, darkness
Water: Submerged, but with strategic air pockets, victory mainly depending on using these to the best advantage
Fire: emphasis is on natural hazards which must be avoided
