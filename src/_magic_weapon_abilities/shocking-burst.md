  description: |
    A shocking burst weapon functions as a shock weapon that also explodes with electricity upon striking a successful critical hit. The electricity does not harm the wielder. In addition to the extra electricity damage from the shock ability, a shocking burst weapon deals an extra {% die_roll 1 10 0 %} points of electricity damage on a successful critical hit. If the weapon's critical multiplier is &times;3, add an extra {% die_roll 2 10 0 %} points of electricity damage instead, and if the multiplier is &times;4, add an extra {% die_roll 3 10 0 %} points. Bows, crossbows, and slings so crafted bestow the electricity energy upon their ammunition.

    Even if the shock ability is not active, the weapon still deals its extra electricity damage on a successful critical hit.
