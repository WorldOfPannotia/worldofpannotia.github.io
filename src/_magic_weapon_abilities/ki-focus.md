    The magic weapon serves as a channel for the wielder's _ki_, allowing her to use her special _ki_ attacks through the weapon as if they were unarmed attacks. These attacks include the monk's stunning attack, _ki_ strike, and quivering palm, as well as the Stunning Fist feat. Only melee weapons can have the _ki_ focus ability.
