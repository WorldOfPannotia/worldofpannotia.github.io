  description: |
    A flaming burst weapon functions as a flaming weapon that also explodes with flame upon striking a successful critical hit. The fire does not harm the wielder. In addition to the extra fire damage from the flaming ability (see above), a flaming burst weapon deals an extra {% die_roll 1 10 0 %} points of fire damage on a successful critical hit. If the weapon's critical multiplier is &times;3, add an extra {% die_roll 2 10 0 %} points of fire damage instead, and if the multiplier is &times;4, add an extra {% die_roll 3 10 0 %} points of fire damage. Bows, crossbows, and slings so crafted bestow the fire energy upon their ammunition.

    Even if the flaming ability is not active, the weapon still deals its extra fire damage on a successful critical hit.
