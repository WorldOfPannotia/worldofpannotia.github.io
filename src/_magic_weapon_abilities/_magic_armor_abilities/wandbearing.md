  description: |
    A shield or piece of armor built with this enhancement has a thin hollow area sized to fit a wand. The wielder or wearer of such an item is considered to be holding the wand when he is holding the shield or wearing the armor, and can use the wand normally. Removing or stowing a wand in a shield with the Wand Bearing property is a move action, while removing or stowing a wand in a suit of armor is a standard action.
