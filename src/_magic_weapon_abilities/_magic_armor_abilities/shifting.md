  description: |
    The armor and enhancement bonuses of this item remain in effect even while the wearer is in an alternate form (such as a lycanthrope's Alternate Form ability). Such items meld into the wearer's alternate form and thus cannot be seen in that form. This item does not work with a Druid's Wild Shape ability, nor does it work with spells that change the form of a creature. It only works with a natural alternate form of a creature.
