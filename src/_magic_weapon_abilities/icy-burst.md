  description: |
    An icy burst weapon functions as a frost weapon that also explodes with frost upon striking a successful critical hit. The frost does not harm the wielder. In addition to the extra damage from the frost ability, an icy burst weapon deals an extra {% die_roll 1 10 0 %} points of cold damage on a successful critical hit. If the weapon's critical multiplier is &times;3, add an extra {% die_roll 2 10 0 %} points of cold damage instead, and if the multiplier is &times;4, add an extra {% die_roll 3 10 0 %} points. Bows, crossbows, and slings so crafted bestow the cold energy upon their ammunition.

    Even if the frost ability is not active, the weapon still deals its extra cold damage on a successful critical hit.
