This ability doubles the threat range of a weapon. Only piercing or slashing weapons can be keen. (If you roll this property randomly for an inappropriate weapon, reroll.) This benefit doesn't stack with any other effect that expands the threat range of a weapon (such as the _keen edge_ spell or the Improved Critical feat).
