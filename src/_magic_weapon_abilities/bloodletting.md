  description: |
    A bloodletting weapon deals 1 additional point of damage per round. Each successful hit on an enemy increases this damage by an additional point. Creatures immune to critical hits (such as plants and constructs) are immune to the extra damage dealt by a bloodletting weapon.

    Magical healing of the same amount or more than the current amount of bleeding damage will stem the bleeding and prevent further damage. This type of healing does not prevent the creature from taking bleeding damage from subsequent hits, however.

    This weapon enhancement can only be added to slashing or piercing weapons. Bows and crossbows bestow the extra damage upon their ammunition.
