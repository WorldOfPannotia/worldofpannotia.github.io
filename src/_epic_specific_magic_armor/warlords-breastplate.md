  description: |
    This _+6 mithril breastplate_ has an armor check penalty of -1, a maximum Dexterity bonus of +5, and an arcane spell failure chance of 15%. It is considered light armor and weighs 15 pounds. It grants the wearer a +4 enhancement bonus to Charisma and allows the wearer to attract and lead a number of followers as if he or she had the {% feat_link leadership %} feat (though this power doesn't allow the wearer to attract a cohort). If the wearer already has the {% feat_link leadership %} feat, this armor has no cumulative effect on his or her followers.
