<p id="warlords-breastplate">**Warlord's Breastplate:** This _+6 mithril breastplate_ has an armor check penalty of -1, a maximum Dexterity bonus of +5, and an arcane spell failure chance of 15%. It is considered light armor and weighs 15 pounds. It grants the wearer a +4 enhancement bonus to Charisma and allows the wearer to attract and lead a number of followers as if he or she had the Leadership feat (though this power doesn't allow the wearer to attract a cohort). If the wearer already has the Leadership feat, this armor has no cumulative effect on his or her followers.
_Caster Level:_ 21st; _Prerequisites:_ Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Epic Magic Arms and Armor, _charm monster_, _sympathy_; _Market Price:_ 416,200 gp; _Cost to Create:_ 210,200 gp + 14,120 XP.
