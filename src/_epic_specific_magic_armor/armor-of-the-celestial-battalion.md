  description: |
    This _+7 chainmail_ is so fine and light that it can be worn under normal clothing without revealing its presence. It has a maximum Dexterity bonus of +10, no armor check penalty, and an arcane spell failure chance of 10%. It is considered light armor, and it allows the wearer to fly at will (as the {% spell_link fly %} spell). Furthermore, the wearer is at all times surrounded by a {% spell_link magic-circle-against-evil %} effect (as the spell) which, if dispelled, can be created again as a free action.
