  description: |
    This _+6 full plate armor's_ clawed gauntlets are effectively +4 keen weapons (1d10/19-20) that afflict the target as if she had been struck by an {% spell_link energy-drain %} spell (Fortitude negates DC 23). The armor bestows two negative levels on any nonevil creature wearing it. These negative levels persist as long as the armor is worn and disappear when the armor is removed. The negative levels never result in actual level loss, but they cannot be overcome in any way (including {% spell_link restoration %} spells) while the armor is worn.
