<p id="dragonskin-armor">**Dragonskin Armor:** This_+5 full plate armor_ is crafted from the hide of a great wyrm dragon. At the wearer's command, the armor sprouts enormous dragon wings, allowing the wearer to fly at a speed of 90 feet (clumsy) for a total of 4 hours each day. The armor also grants immunity to a specific type of energy, based on the color of dragon that supplied the armor. Roll d% on the following table to determine the color and immunity.
