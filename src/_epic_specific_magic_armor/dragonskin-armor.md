  description: |
    This _+5 full plate armor_ is crafted from the hide of a great wyrm dragon. At the wearer's command, the armor sprouts enormous dragon wings, allowing the wearer to fly at a speed of 90 feet (clumsy) for a total of 4 hours each day. The armor also grants immunity to a specific type of energy, based on the color of dragon that supplied the armor. Roll d% on the following table to determine the color and immunity.

    |---
    | d% | Color | Immunity
    |-|-|-
    | 01-10 | Black | Acid
    | 11-20 | Blue | Lightning
    | 21-30 | Brass | Fire
    | 31-40 | Bronze | Lightning
    | 41-50 | Copper | Acid
    | 51-60 | Gold | Fire
    | 61-70 | Green | Acid
    | 71-80 | Red | Fire

    The wearer of the armor takes a -4 circumstance penalty on {% skill_link diplomacy %} checks with dragons, but gains a +4 circumstance bonus on {% skill_link intimidate %} checks against dragons.
