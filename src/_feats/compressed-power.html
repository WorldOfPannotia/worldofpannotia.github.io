feat:
  name: "Compressed Power"
  types: ["Metapsionic"]
  description: |
    You can compress the effects of a power into a smaller area with higher than normal intensity.
  benefit: |
    You can alter a burst, emanation, line, or spread shaped power to compress its area. Any numeric measurements of the power's area are reduced by 50%. All variable, numeric effects of a compressed power are doubled.

    Using this feat increases the power point cost of the power by 4. The power's total cost cannot exceed your manifester level.

    Powers that do not have an area of one of these four sorts are not affected by this feat.
