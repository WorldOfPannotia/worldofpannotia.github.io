title: "Mental Resistance"

feat:
  types: ["General"]
  description: |
    Your mind is armored against mental intrusion.
  prerequisite: |
    Base Will save bonus +2.
  benefit: |
    Against psionic attacks that do not employ an energy type to deal damage you gain damage reduction 3/-. In addition, when you are hit with ability damage (but not ability drain or ability burn damage) from a psionic attack, you take 3 points less than you would normally take.

    The benefit of this feat applies only to psionic powers and psi-like abilities. This is an exception to the psionics-magic transparency rule.
  special: |
    You cannot take or use this feat if you have the ability to use powers (if you have a power point reserve or psi-like abilities).
