feat:
  name: "Brew Potion"
  types: ["Item Creation"]
  prerequisite: |
    Caster level 3rd; or _craft (alchemy)_ 4 ranks and Caster level 1st.
  benefit: |
    You can create a potion of any 3rd-level or lower spell that you know and that targets one or more creatures. Brewing a potion takes one hour per level of the spell you are using for the potion. When you create a potion, you set the caster level, which must be sufficient to cast the spell in question and no higher than your own level. The base price of a potion is its spell level &times; its caster level &times; 50 gp. To brew a potion, you must spend 1/25 of this base price in XP and use up raw materials costing one half this base price.

    When you create a potion, you make any choices that you would normally make when casting the spell. Whoever drinks the potion is the target of the spell.

    Any potion that stores a spell with a costly material component or an XP cost also carries a commensurate cost. In addition to the costs derived from the base price, you must expend the material component or pay the XP when creating the potion.
  special: |
    For every 5 ranks you have in _craft (alchemy)_, the total time time for brewing a potion is reduced 10%, to a maximum of -50% (rounded to the nearest half-hour). This cannot reduce the time to less than one hour for a potion or batch of potions.

    In addition, potions may be brewed in batches. Each batch may have a maximum of 10 potions or 10,000gp worth of potions, whichever is less. Brewing potions in a batch does not increase the time it takes to brew, but it does increase the XP and raw materials costs. For every potion past the first, add &#189; of the base XP and raw material cost to the total.

    _For example, a 10th-level cleric decides to brew a batch of 10 cure serious wounds potions at CL 5. The base price for these potions is 750 gp (5 &times; 3 &times; 50 gp) and the XP and raw materials cost are 30 XP and 375 gp, respectively. Each potion after the first would therefore have an XP and raw materials cost of 15 XP and 188 gp (187.5 gp, rounded up), respectively. Therefore, the batch of potions would cost the cleric a total of 165 XP ([9 &times; 15] + 30) and 2,067 gp ([9 &times; 188] + 372) and take 3 hours. If this same cleric had 13 ranks in _craft (alchemy)_, the total time would be 2.5 hours._
