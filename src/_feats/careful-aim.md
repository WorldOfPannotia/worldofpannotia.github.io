title: "Careful Aim"

feat:
  types: ["General", "Fighter"]
  description: |
    You can forgo multiple shots in a round to deal more damage on a single shot.
  prerequisite: |
    Point-Blank Shot, base attack bonus 6+, Wis 13
  benefit: |
    You can make a single careful shot as a full attack action. Your careful shot deals extra damage for every potential attack you give up. This damage is equal to the 1d8 plus any enhancement bonuses your arrow or bow has. For example, if a character has a medium size composite longbow with a strength rating of +2 and a base attack bonus of +11, he could sacrifice two of his attacks for a single attack that dealt an extra 2d8+4 damage.

    If the bow has magical properties, such as the flaming or expansion abilities, the damage from those abilities is not factored into the extra damage. For example, if a character has a +1 flaming composite longbow (Str +2) and sacrificed two attacks, the extra damage would be 2d8+6 (1d8+2 base damage &times; two sacrificed attacks, +1 weapon enhancement &times; two sacrificed attacks).
  special: |
    A fighter may select Careful Aim as one of his fighter bonus feats.
