title: "Maximize Spell"

feat:
  types: ["Metamagic"]
  benefit: |
    All variable, numeric effects of a spell modified by this feat are maximized. Saving throws and opposed rolls are not affected, nor are spells without random variables.

    A maximized spell uses up a spell slot three levels higher than the spell's actual level.

    An empowered, maximized spell gains the separate benefits of each feat: the maximum result plus one-half the normally rolled result.
