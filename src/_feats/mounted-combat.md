title: "Mounted Combat"

feat:
  types: ["General", "Fighter"]
  prerequisite: |
    {% skill_link ride %} 1 rank.
  benefit: |
    Once per round when your mount is hit in combat, you may attempt a {% skill_link ride %} check (as a reaction) to negate the hit. The hit is negated if your {% skill_link ride %} check result is greater than the opponent's attack roll. (Essentially, the {% skill_link ride %} check result becomes the mount's Armor Class if it's higher than the mount's regular AC.)
  special: |
    A fighter may select Mounted Combat as one of his fighter bonus feats.
