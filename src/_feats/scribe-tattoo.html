feat:
  name: "Scribe Tattoo"
  types: ["Item Creation"]
  description: |
    You can create psionic tattoos, which store powers within their designs.
  prerequisite: |
    Manifester level 3rd.
  benefit: |
    You can create a psionic tattoo of any power of 3rd level or lower that you know and that targets one or more creatures. Scribing a psionic tattoo takes one day. When you create a psionic tattoo, you set the manifester level. The manifester level must be sufficient to manifest the power in question and no higher than your own level. The base price of a psionic tattoo is its power level &times; its manifester level &times; 50 gp. To scribe a tattoo, you must spend 1/25 of this base price in XP and use up raw materials (special inks, masterwork needles, and so on) costing one-half of this base price.

    When you create a psionic tattoo, you make any choices that you would normally make when manifesting the power.

    When its wearer physically activates the tattoo, the wearer is the target of the power.

    Any psionic tattoo that stores a power with an XP cost also carries a commensurate cost. In addition to the costs derived from the base price, you must pay the XP when creating the tattoo.
