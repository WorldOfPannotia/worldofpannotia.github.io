title: "Repeat Spell"

feat:
  types: ["Metamagic"]
  prerequisite: |
    Any other metamagic feat.
  benefit: |
    A repeated spell is automatically cast again at the beginning of your next round of actions. No matter where you are, the secondary spell originates from the same location and affects the same area as the primary spell. If the repeated spell designates a target, the secondary spell retargets the same target if the target is within 30 feet of its original position; otherwise the secondary spell fails to go off. A repeated spell uses up a spell slot three levels higher than the spell's actual level. Repeat Spell cannot be used on spells with a range of touch.
