title: "Quicken Spell-Like Ability"

feat:
  types: ["General"]
  prerequisite: |
    Spell-like ability at caster level 10th or higher.
  benefit: |
    Choose one of the creature's spell-like abilities, subject to the restrictions described below. The creature can use that ability as a quickened spell-like ability three times per day (or less, if the ability is normally usable only once or twice per day).

    Using a quickened spell-like ability is a free action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. The creature can perform another action—including the use of another spell-like ability—in the same round that it uses a quickened spell-like ability. The creature may use only one quickened spell-like ability per round.

    The creature can only select a spell-like ability duplicating a spell with a level less than or equal to half its caster level (round down) -4. For a summary, see the table below.

    In addition, a spell-like ability that duplicates a spell with a casting time greater than 1 full round cannot be quickened.
  normal: |
    Normally the use of a spell-like ability requires a standard action and provokes an attack of opportunity unless noted otherwise.
  special: |
    This feat can be taken multiple times. Each time it is taken, the creature can apply it to a different one of its spell-like abilities.
