feat:
  name: "Scribe Scroll"
  types: ["Item Creation"]
  prerequisite: |
    Caster level 1st.
  benefit: |
    You can create a scroll of any spell that you know. Scribing a scroll takes one hour for each spell level on the scroll. The base price of a scroll is its spell level &times; its caster level &times; 25 gp. To scribe a scroll, you must spend 1/25 of this base price in XP and use up raw materials costing one-half of this base price.

    Any scroll that stores a spell with a costly material component or an XP cost also carries a commensurate cost. In addition to the costs derived from the base price, you must expend the material component or pay the XP when scribing the scroll.
  special: |
    0-Level spells count as &#189; level for the purpose of determining the time it takes to scribe the spell and the base price of the scroll.
