title: "Empower Spell-Like Ability"

feat:
  types: ["General"]
  prerequisite: |
    Spell-like ability at caster level 6th or higher.
  benefit: |
    Choose one of the creature's spell-like abilities, subject to the restrictions below. The creature can use that ability as an empowered spell-like ability three times per day (or less, if the ability is normally usable only once or twice per day).

    When a creature uses an empowered spell-like ability, all variable, numeric effects of the spell-like ability are increased by one half. Saving throws and opposed rolls are not affected. Spell-like abilities without random variables are not affected.

    The creature can only select a spell-like ability duplicating a spell with a level less than or equal to half its caster level (round down) -2. For a summary, see the table in the description of the Quicken Spell-Like Ability feat.
  special: |
    This feat can be taken multiple times. Each time it is taken, the creature can apply it to a different one of its spell-like abilities.
