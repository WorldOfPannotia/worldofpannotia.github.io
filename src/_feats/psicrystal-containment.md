title: "Psicrystal Containment"

feat:
  types: ["Psionic"]
  description: |
    Your psicrystal has advanced enough that it can hold a psionic focus that you store within it.
  prerequisite: |
    Psicrystal Affinity, manifester level 3rd.
  benefit: |
    You can spend a full-round action attempting to psionically focus your psicrystal. At any time when you need to expend your psionic focus, you can expend your psicrystal's psionic focus instead, as long as the crystal is within 5 feet of you. Psionically focusing your psicrystal works just like focusing yourself. The psicrystal cannot focus itself &ndash; only the owner can spend the time to focus the crystal.
