feat:
  name: "Delay Spell"
  types: ["Metamagic"]
  description: |
    You can cast spells that go off up to 5 rounds later.
  benefit: |
    You can cast a spell as a delayed spell. A delayed spell doesn't activate immediately. When you cast the spell, you choose one of three trigger mechanisms: (1) The spell activates when you take a standard action to activate it; (2) It activates when a creature enters the area that the spell will affect (only spell that affect areas can use this trigger condition); or (3) It activates on your turn after 5 rounds pass. If you choose one of the first two triggers and the conditions are not met within 5 rounds, the spell activates automatically on the fifth round.

    Only area and personal spells can be delayed.

    Any decisions you would make about the delayed spell, including attack rolls, designating targets, or determining or shaping an area, are decided when the spell is cast. Any effects resolved by those affected by the spell, including saving throws, are decided when the delay period ends.

    A delayed spell can be dispelled normally during the delay, and can be detected normally in the area or on the target by the use of spells that can detect magical effects.

    A delayed spell uses up a spell slot one level higher than the spell's actual level.
