feat:
  name: "Wand Mastery"
  types: ["Metamagic"]
  prerequisite: |
    Craft Wand.
  benefit: |
    When using a wand, you may give up one of your spells per day to cast a spell from the wand instead. Using this ability is equivalent to using the wand normally, except it does not reduce the number of charges in the wand. The spell slot used for this ability must be of the same or higher level than the spell being cast from the wand.
