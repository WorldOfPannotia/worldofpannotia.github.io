feat:
  name: "Plant Control"
  types: ["General"]
  prerequisite: |
    Plant Defiance, ability to cast _speak with plants_.
  benefit: |
    You can rebuke or command plant creatures as an evil cleric rebukes undead. To command a plant, you must be able to speak with it via a _speak with plants_ effect, though it may do so mentally if desired. This ability is usable a total number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier. You use your highest caster level to determine the level at which you rebuke plants.
