title: "Greater Manyshot"
slug: "greater-manyshot"

feat:
  name: "Greater Manyshot"
  types: ["General", "Fighter"]
  description: |
    You are skilled at firing many arrows at once, even at different opponents.
  prerequisite: |
    Dex 17, Manyshot, Point Blank Shot, Rapid Shot, base attack bonus +6.
  benefit: |
    When you use the Manyshot feat, you can fire each arrow at a different target instead of firing all of them at the same target. You make a separate attack roll for each arrow, regardless of whether you fire them at separate targets or the same target. Your precision-based damage applies to each arrow fired, and, if you score a critical hit with more than one of the arrows, each critical hit deals critical damage.
  special: |
    A fighter may select this feat as one of his fighter bonus feats.
