    Dex 13, Speed of Thought.
  benefit: |
    To use this feat, you must expend your psionic focus. When you charge, you can make one turn of up to 90 degrees during your movement. All other restrictions on charges still apply; for instance, you cannot pass through a square that blocks or slows movement, or that contains a creature. You must have line of sight to the opponent at the start of your turn.
