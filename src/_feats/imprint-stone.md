title: "Imprint Stone"

feat:
  types: ["Item Creation"]
  description: |
    You can create power stones to store psionic powers.
  prerequisite: |
    Manifester level 1st.
  benefit: |
    You can create a power stone of any power that you know. Encoding a power stone takes one day for each 1,000 gp in its base price. The base price of a power stone is the level of the stored power &times; its manifester level &times; 25 gp. To imprint a power stone, you must spend 1/25 of this base price in XP and use up raw materials costing one-half of this base price.

    Any power stone that stores a power with an XP cost also carries a commensurate cost. In addition to the costs derived from the base price, you must pay the XP when encoding the stone.
