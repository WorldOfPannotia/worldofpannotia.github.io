feat:
  name: "Compressed Spell"
  types: ["Metamagic"]
  description: |
    You can compress the effects of a spell into a smaller area with higher than normal intensity.
  benefit: |
    You can alter a burst, emanation, line, or spread shaped spell to compress its area. Any numeric measurements of the spell's area are reduced by 50%. All variable, numeric effects of an empowered spell are doubled.

    A compressed spell uses up a spell slot three levels higher than the spell's actual level.

    Spells that do not have an area of one of these four sorts are not affected by this feat.
