feat:
  name: "Ranged Power"
  types: ["Metapsionic"]
  description: |
    You can manifest powers with a reach of touch without actually touching the target.
  benefit: |
    You can manifest a power with a reach of touch on any valid target within 30 ft. To do so, you must make a ranged touch attack against the target's AC. If this touch attack fails, the power fails (all the power points spent on the power are lost).

    Using this feat increases the power point cost of the power by 2. The power's total cost cannot exceed your manifester level.
