title: "Craft Dorje"

feat:
  types: ["Item Creation"]
  description: |
    You can create slender crystal wands called dorjes than manifest powers when charges are expended.
  prerequisite: |
    Manifester level 5th.
  benefit: |
    You can create a dorje of any psionic power you know (barring exceptions, such as {% spell_link bestow-power %}, as noted in a power's description). Crafting a dorje takes one day for each 1,000 gp in its base price. The base price of a dorje is its manifester level &times; the power level &times; 750 gp. To craft a dorje, you must spend 1/25 of this base price in XP and use up raw materials costing one-half of this base price.

    A newly created dorje has 50 charges.

    Any dorje that stores a power with an XP cost also carries a commensurate cost. In addition to the XP cost derived from the base price, you must pay fifty times the XP cost.
