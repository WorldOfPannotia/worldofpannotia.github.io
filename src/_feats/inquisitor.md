feat:
  types: ["Psionic"]
  description: |
    You know when others lie.
  prerequisite: |
    Wis 13.
  benefit: |
    To use this feat, you must expend your psionic focus.

    You gain a +10 bonus on a {% skill_link sense-motive %} check to oppose a {% skill_link bluff %} check.

    You must decide whether or not to use this feat prior to making a Sense Motive check. If your check fails, or if the opponent isn't lying, you still expend your psionic focus.
