title: "Quicken Power"

feat:
  types: ["Metapsionic"]
  description: |
    You can manifest a power with a moment's thought.
  benefit: |
    To use this feat, you must expend your psionic focus. You can quicken a power. You can perform another action, even manifest another power, in the same round that you manifest a quickened power. You can manifest only one quickened power per round. A power whose manifesting time is longer than 1 round cannot be quickened.

    Using this feat increases the power point cost of the power by 6. The power's total cost cannot exceed your manifester level.

    Manifesting a quickened power does not provoke attacks of opportunity.
