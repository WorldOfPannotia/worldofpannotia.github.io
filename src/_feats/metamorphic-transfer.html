feat:
  name: "Metamorphic Transfer"
  types: ["Psionic"]
  description: |
    You can gain a supernatural ability of a metamorphed form.
  prerequisite: |
    Wis 13, manifester level 5th.
  benefit: |
    Each time you change your form, such as through the _metamorphosis_ power, you gain one of the new form's supernatural abilities, if it has any.

    You gain only three uses of the metamorphic ability per day, even if the creature into which you metamorph has a higher limit on uses (You are still subject to other restrictions on the use of the ability.) The save DC to resist a supernatural ability gained through Metamorphic Transfer (if it is an attack) is 10 + your Cha modifier + &#189; your Hit Dice.
  normal: |
    You cannot use the supernatural abilities of creatures whose form you assume.
  special: |
    You can gain this feat multiple times. Each time, you can gain one additional supernatural ability.
