title: "Disguise Spell"

feat:
  types: ["Metamagic"]
  prerequisite: |
    Bardic music, _perform_ 12 ranks.
  benefit: |
    You have mastered the art of casting spells unobtrusively, mingling verbal and somatic components into its music and performances so that others rarely catch you in the act of casting a spell. Like a silent, stilled spell, a disguised spell can't be identified through Spellcraft. Your performance is obvious to everyone in the vicinity, but the fact that you are casting a spell isn't. Unless the spell visibly emanates from you or observers have some other means of determining its source, they don't know where the effect came from. A disguised spell uses up a spell slot one level higher than the spell's actual level.
