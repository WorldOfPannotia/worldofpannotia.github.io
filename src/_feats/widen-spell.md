title: "Widen Spell"

feat:
  types: ["Metamagic"]
  benefit: |
    You can alter a burst, emanation, line, or spread shaped spell to increase its area. Any numeric measurements of the spell's area increase by 100%.

    A widened spell uses up a spell slot three levels higher than the spell's actual level.

    Spells that do not have an area of one of these four sorts are not affected by this feat.
