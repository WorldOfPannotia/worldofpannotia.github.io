title: "Force of Will"

feat:
  types: ["General"]
  description: |
    You are able to resist psionic attacks with extreme force of will.
  prerequisite: |
    Iron Will.
  benefit: |
    Once per round, when targeted by a psionic effect that allows a Reflex save or a Fortitude save, you can instead make a Will saving throw to avoid the effect.

    The benefit of this feat applies only to psionic powers and psi-like abilities. This is an exception to the psionics-magic transparency rule.
  special: |
    You cannot take or use this feat if you have the ability to use powers (if you have a power point reserve or psi-like abilities).
