feat:
  name: "Antipsionic Magic"
  types: ["General"]
  description: |
    Your spells are more potent when used against psionic characters and creatures.
  prerequisite: |
    _spellcraft_ 5 ranks.
  benefit: |
    You get a get a +2 bonus on caster level checks made to overcome a psionic creature's power resistance.

    This bonus stacks with the bonus conferred by Spell Penetration and Greater Spell Penetration. Moreover, whenever a psionic creature attempts to dispel a spell you cast, it makes its manifester level check against a DC of 13 + its manifester level.

    The benefits of this feat apply only to power resistance.

    The bonus does not apply to spell resistance. This is an exception to the psionics-magic transparency rule.
  special: |
    You cannot take or use this feat if you have the ability to use powers (if you have a power point reserve or psi-like abilities).
