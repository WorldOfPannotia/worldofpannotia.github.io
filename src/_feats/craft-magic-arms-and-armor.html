feat:
  name: "Craft Magic Arms and Armor"
  types: ["Item Creation"]
  prerequisite: |
    Caster level 5th; or 4 ranks in an appropriate _craft_ skill (metal smithing, armor, etc.) and Caster level 1st.
  benefit: |
    You can create any magic weapon, armor, or shield whose prerequisites you meet. Enhancing a weapon, suit of armor, or shield takes one day for each 1,000 gp in the price of its magical features. To enhance a weapon, suit of armor, or shield, you must spend 1/25 of its features' total price in XP and use up raw materials costing one-half of this total price.

    The weapon, armor, or shield to be enhanced must be a masterwork item that you provide. Its cost is not included in the above cost.

    You can also mend a broken magic weapon, suit of armor, or shield if it is one that you could make. Doing so costs half the XP, half the raw materials, and half the time it would take to craft that item in the first place.
  special: |
    For every 10 ranks you have in the appropriate _craft_ or _craft_ skill (metal smithing, armor, etc.), you reduce the total time for crafting by 5%, to a maximum of -50%. This reduction cannot bring the time lower than 1 day per point of total enhancement bonus.
