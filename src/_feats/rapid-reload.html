title: "Rapid Reload"
slug: "rapid-reload"

feat:
  name: "Rapid Reload"
  types: ["General", "Fighter"]
  description: |
    Choose a type of crossbow (hand, light, or heavy).
  prerequisite: |
    Weapon Proficiency (crossbow type chosen).
  benefit: |
    The time required for you to reload your chosen type of crossbow is reduced to a free action (for a hand or light crossbow) or a move action (for a heavy crossbow). Reloading a crossbow still provokes an attack of opportunity.

    If you have selected this feat for hand crossbow or light crossbow, you may fire that weapon as many times in a full attack action as you could attack if you were using a bow.
  normal: |
    A character without this feat needs a move action to reload a hand or light crossbow, or a full-round action to reload a heavy crossbow.
  special: |
    You can gain Rapid Reload multiple times. Each time you take the feat, it applies to a new type of crossbow.

    A fighter may select Rapid Reload as one of his fighter bonus feats.
