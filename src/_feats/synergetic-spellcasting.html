title: "Synergetic Spellcasting"
slug: "synergetic-spellcasting"

feat:
  name: "Synergetic Spellcasting"
  types: ["Metamagic"]
  description: |
    You are capable of working with other spellcasters to weave magic together for greater effects.
  benefit: |
    If two casters with this feat are working in cooperation with each other, they can combine their spells to enhance the effects of their spellcasting. See the <a href="">synergetic spells list</a> to see the spell combinations that work with this feat. You can also ask your DM for approval on custom synergies.
  special: |
    For spells that require saves, always use the average of the two spells (rounded up), if both spells require a save. If only one spell requires a save, use that DC for the synergized spell. If neither spell grants a save, the synergized spell does not grant one either.

    This principle is the same for spell resistance. If one or both spells are affected by spell resistance, the synergized spell is as well. If neither spell is affected by spell resistance, the synergized spell is also not affected.
