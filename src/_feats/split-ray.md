title: "Split Ray"

feat:
  types: ["Metamagic"]
  description: |
    You can affect two targets with a single ray.
  benefit: |
    You can split rays you cast. The split ray affects any two targets that are both within the spell's range and within 30 feet of each other. If the ray deals damage, each target takes as much damage as a single target would take.

    A split spell uses up a spell slot two levels higher than the spell's actual level.

    Alternately, you may choose to have the split spell deal half as much damage as normal (rounded down) to each target. A split spell used this way uses up a spell slot of the normal level of the spell.
