feat:
  types: ["Item Creation"]
  description: |
    You can create psicrowns, which have multiple psionic effects.
  prerequisite: |
    Manifester level 12th.
  benefit: |
    You can create any psicrown whose prerequisites you meet. Crafting a psicrown takes one day for each 1,000 gp in its base price. To craft a psicrown, you must spend 1/25 of its base price in XP and use up raw materials costing one-half of its base price. Some psicrowns incur extra costs in XP as noted in their descriptions. These costs are in addition to those derived from the psicrown's base price.
