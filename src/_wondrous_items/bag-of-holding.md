  description: |
    This appears to be a common cloth sack about 2 feet by 4 feet in size. The _bag of holding_ opens into a nondimensional space: Its inside is larger than its outside dimensions. Regardless of what is put into the bag, it weighs a fixed amount. This weight, and the limits in weight and volume of the bag's contents, depend on the bag's type, as shown on the table below.

    |---
    | Bag | Bag Weight | Contents Weight Limit | Contents Volume Limit | Market Price
    |-|-|-|-|-
    | Type I | 15 lb. | 250 lb. | 30 cu. ft. | 2,500 gp
    | Type II | 25 lb. | 500 lb. | 70 cu. ft. | 5,000 gp
    | Type III | 35 lb. | 1,000 lb. | 150 cu. ft. | 7,400 gp
    | Type IV | 60 lb. | 1,500 lb. | 250 cu. ft. | 10,000 gp

    If the bag is overloaded, or if sharp objects pierce it (from inside or outside), the bag ruptures and is ruined. All contents are lost forever. If a _bag of holding_ is turned inside out, its contents spill out, unharmed, but the bag must be put right before it can be used again. If living creatures are placed within the bag, they can survive for up to 10 minutes, after which time they suffocate. Retrieving a specific item from a _bag of holding_ is a move action &ndash; unless the bag contains more than an ordinary backpack would hold, in which case retrieving a specific item is a full-round action.

    If a _bag of holding_ is placed within a _portable hole_ a rift to the Astral Plane is torn in the space: Bag and hole alike are sucked into the void and forever lost. If a _portable hole_ is placed within a _bag of holding_, it opens a gate to the Astral Plane: The hole, the bag, and any creatures within a 10-foot radius are drawn there, destroying the _portable hole_ and _bag of holding_ in the process.
