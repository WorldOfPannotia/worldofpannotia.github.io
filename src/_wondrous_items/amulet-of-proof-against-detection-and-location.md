  description: |
    This silver amulet protects the wearer from scrying and magical location just as a {% spell_link nondetection %} spell does. If a divination spell is attempted against the wearer, the caster of the divination must succeed on a caster level check ({% die_roll 1 20 0 %} + caster level) against a DC of 19 (as if the caster had cast {% spell_link nondetection %} on herself ).
