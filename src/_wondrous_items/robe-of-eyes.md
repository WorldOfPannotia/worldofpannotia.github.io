  description: |
    This valuable garment appears to be a normal robe until it is put on. Its wearer is able to see in all directions at the same moment due to scores of visible, magical eyelike patterns that adorn the robe. She also gains 120-foot darkvision.

    The _robe of eyes_ sees all forms of invisible or ethereal things within 120 feet.

    The wearer of a _robe of eyes_ gains a +10 competence bonus on {% skill_link search %} checks and {% skill_link spot %} checks. She retains her Dexterity bonus to AC even when flat-footed, and she can't be flanked. However, she is not able to avert her eyes or close her eyes when confronted by a creature with a gaze attack.

    A {% spell_link light %} or {% spell_link continual-flame %} spell cast directly on a _robe of eyes_ causes it to be blinded for 1d3 minutes. A {% spell_link daylight %} spell blinds it for 2d4 minutes.
