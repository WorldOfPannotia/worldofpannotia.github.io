  description: |
    These crystal lenses fit over the user's eyes, enabling him to cast {% spell_link doom %} upon those around him (one target per round) as a gaze attack, except that the wearer must take a standard action, and those merely looking at the wearer are not affected. Those failing a DC 11 Will save are affected as by the {% spell_link doom %} spell. If the wearer has only one lens, the DC of the saving throw is reduced to 10. However, if the wearer has both lenses, he gains the additional power of a continual {% spell_link deathwatch %} effect and can use {% spell_link fear %} (Will DC 16 partial) as a normal gaze attack once per week.
