  description: |
    This magic instrument comes in four varieties. Each appears to be normal until someone speaks its command word and blows the horn. Then the horn summons a number of human barbarians to fight for the character who summoned them. Each horn can be blown just once every seven days. Roll d% and refer to the table below to see what type of horn is found. The horn's type determines what barbarians are summoned and what prerequisite is needed to use the horn. Any character who uses a _horn of Valhalla_ but doesn't have the prerequisite is attacked by the barbarians she herself summoned.

    |---
    | d% | Type of Horn | Barbarians Summoned | Prerequisite
    |-|-|-|-
    | 01-40 | Silver | 2d4+2, 2nd level | None
    | 41-75 | Brass | 2d4+1, 3rd level | Spellcaster level 1st
    | 76-90 | Bronze | 2d4, 4th level | Proficiency with all martial weapons or bardic music ability
    | 91-100 | Iron | 1d4+1, 5th level | Proficiency with all martial weapons or bardic music ability

    Summoned barbarians are constructs, not actual people (though they seem to be); they arrive with the starting equipment for barbarians. They attack anyone the possessor of the horn commands them to fight until they or their opponents are slain or until 1 hour has elapsed, whichever comes first.
