  description: |
    This horn appears to be a normal trumpet. It can be sounded as a normal horn, but if the command word is spoken and the instrument is then played, it deals {% die_roll 5 6 0 %} points of sonic damage to creatures within a 40-foot cone and causes them to be deafened for {% die_roll 2 6 0 %} rounds (a DC 16 Fortitude save reduces the damage by half and negates the deafening). Crystalline objects and creatures take {% die_roll 7 6 0 %} points of sonic damage, with no save unless they're held, worn, or carried by creatures (Will DC 16 negates).

    If a _horn of blasting_ is used magically more than once in a given day, there is a 20% cumulative chance with each extra use that it explodes and deals {% die_roll 10 6 0 %} points of damage to the person sounding it.
