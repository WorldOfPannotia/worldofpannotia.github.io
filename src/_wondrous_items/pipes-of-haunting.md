  description: |
    This magic item appears to be a small set of pan pipes. When played by a person who succeeds on a DC 15 _perform (wind instruments)_ check, the pipes create an eerie, spellbinding tune. Those within 30 feet who hear the tune must succeed on a DC 13 Will save or become frightened for 4 rounds. Creatures with 6 or more Hit Dice are unaffected. _Pipes of haunting_ can be sounded twice a day.
