    This ointment has two uses. If an ounce of it is applied to the flesh of a petrified creature, it returns the creature to flesh as the {% spell_link stone-to-flesh %} spell. If an ounce of it is applied to the flesh of a nonpetrified creature, it protects the creature as a {% spell_link stoneskin %} spell.
