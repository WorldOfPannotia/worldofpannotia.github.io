  description: |
    This horn functions as a _horn of blasting_, except that it deals 10d6 points of sonic damage, stuns creatures for 1 round, and deafens them for 4d6 rounds (a DC 19 Fortitude reduces the damage by half and negates the stunning and deafening). Crystalline objects take 16d6 points of sonic damage as described for the _horn of blasting_. A _greater horn of blasting_ also has a 20% cumulative chance of exploding.
