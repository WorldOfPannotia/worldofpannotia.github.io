  description: |
    The lenses of this item are made of special crystal. When placed over the eyes of the wearer, the lenses enable her to see much better than normal at distances of 1 foot or less, granting her a +5 competence bonus on _search_ checks to find secret doors, traps, and similar concealed objects. Both lenses must be worn for the magic to be effective.
