  description: |
    This device appears to be a normal container for holding burning coals. When a fire is lit in the brazier and the proper summoning words are spoken, a Large fire elemental appears. The summoning words require 1 full round to speak. In all ways the brazier functions as the {% spell_link summon-monster-vi %} spell. If brimstone is added, the elemental is Huge instead of Large, and the brazier works as a {% spell_link summon-monster-vii %} spell. Only one elemental can be summoned at a time. A new elemental requires a new fire, which cannot be lit until after the first elemental disappears (is dispelled, dismissed, or slain).
