  description: |
    This is the most common form of scrying device, a crystal sphere about 6 inches in diameter. A character can use the device to see over virtually any distance or into other planes of existence, as with the spell {% spell_link scrying %} (Will DC 16 negates).

    Certain _crystal balls_ have additional powers that can be used through the _crystal ball_ on the target viewed.
