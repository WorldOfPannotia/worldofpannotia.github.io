  description: |
    This footgear bestows many powers upon the wearer. First, he is able to travel across snow at his normal speed, leaving no tracks. The boots also enable him to travel at normal speed across the most slippery ice (horizontal surfaces only, not vertical or sharply slanted ones) without falling or slipping. Finally, _boots of the winterlands_ warm the wearer, as if he were affected by an {% spell_link endure-elements %} spell.
