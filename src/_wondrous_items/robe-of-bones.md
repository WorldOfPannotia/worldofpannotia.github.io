  description: |
    This handy item functions much like a _robe of useful items_ for the serious necromancer. It appears to be an unremarkable robe, but a character who dons it notes that it is adorned with small embroidered figures representing undead creatures. Only the wearer of the robe can see the embroidery and recognize them for the creatures they become, and detach them. One figure can be detached each round. Detaching a figure causes it to become an actual undead creature (see the list below). The skeleton or zombie is not under the control of the wearer of the robe, but may be subsequently commanded, rebuked, turned, or destroyed. A newly created _robe of bones_ always has two embroidered figures of each of the following undead:

     * Small goblin skeleton
     * Medium human commoner skeleton
     * Medium wolf skeleton
     * Small goblin zombie
     * Medium human commoner zombie
     * Medium wolf zombie
