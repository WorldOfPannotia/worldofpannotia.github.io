  description: |
    This unremarkable powder resembles chalk dust or powdered graphite. Stare at it, however, and the dust changes color and form. Put _dust of illusion_ on a creature, and that creature is affected as if by a {% spell_link disguise-self %} glamer, with the individual who sprinkles the dust envisioning the illusion desired. An unwilling target is allowed a DC 11 Reflex save to avoid the dust. The glamer lasts for 2 hours.
