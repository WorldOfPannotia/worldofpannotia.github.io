  description: |
    This garment is typically black or dark blue and embroidered with small white or silver stars. The robe has three magical powers.

     * It enables its wearer to travel physically to the Astral Plane, along with all that she is wearing or carrying.
     * It gives its wearer a +1 luck bonus on all saving throws.
     * Its wearer can use up to six of the embroidered stars on the chest portion of the robe as _+5 shuriken_. The robe grants its wearer proficiency with such weapons. Each shuriken disappears after it is used.
