  description: |
    Each item of this nature appears to be a full-sized, roughly hewn statue of a horse, carved from some type of hard stone. A command word brings the steed to life, enabling it to carry a burden and even to attack as if it were a real horse of the appropriate kind.

    A _stone horse_ can carry 1,000 pounds tirelessly and never needs to rest or feed. Damage dealt to it can be repaired by first using a {% spell_link stone-to-flesh %} spell, thus causing the _stone horse_ to become a normal horse that can be healed normally. When fully healed, it automatically reverts to its stone form. While in its stone form, it can be fed gems, healing 1 point of damage for each 50 gp worth of mineral it is given.

    There are two sorts of _stone horses_.

    _Courser:_ This item has the statistics of a heavy horse as well as having hardness 10.

    _Destrier:_ This item has the statistics of a heavy warhorse as well as having hardness 10.
