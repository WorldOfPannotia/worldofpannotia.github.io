  description: |
    This device is a conch shell that can be blown once per day except by a triton which can sound it three times per day. A _horn of the tritons_ can perform any one of the following functions when blown.

     * Calm rough waters in a 1-mile radius. This effect dispels a summoned water elemental if it fails a DC 16 Will save.
     * Attract {% die_roll 5 4 0 %} Large sharks (01-30 on d%), {% die_roll 5 6 0 %} Medium sharks (31-80), or {% die_roll 1 10 0 %} sea lions (81-100) if the character is in a body of water in which such creatures dwell. The creatures are friendly and obey, to the best of their ability, the one who sounded the horn.
     * Causes aquatic creatures with Intelligence scores of 1 or 2 within 500 feet to become panicked as if they had been targeted by a {% spell_link fear %} spell (Will DC 16 partial). Those who successfully save are shaken for {% die_roll 3 6 0 %} rounds.

    Any sounding of a _horn of the tritons_ can be heard by all tritons within a 3-mile radius.
