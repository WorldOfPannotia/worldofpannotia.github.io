  description: |
    A _rope of entanglement_ looks just like any other hempen rope about 30 feet long. Upon command, the rope lashes forward 20 feet or upward 10 feet to entangle a victim. An entangled creature can break free with a DC 20 Strength check or a DC 20 {% skill_link escape-artist %} check.

    The rope has AC 22, 12 hit points, and hardness 10, and it has damage reduction 5/slashing as well. The rope repairs damage to itself at a rate of 1 point per 5 minutes, but if a _rope of entanglement_ is severed (all 12 hit points lost to damage), it is destroyed.
