  description: |
    When worn, a pair of these slippers enable movement on vertical surfaces or even upside down along ceilings, leaving the wearer's hands free. Her speed is 20 feet. Severely slippery surfaces &ndash; icy, oiled, or greased surfaces make these slippers useless. The slippers can be used for 10 minutes per day, split up as the wearer chooses.
