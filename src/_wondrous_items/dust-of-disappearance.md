  description: |
    This dust looks just like _dust of appearance_ and is typically stored in the same manner. A creature or object touched by it becomes invisible (as {% spell_link invisibility-greater %}). Normal vision can't see dusted creatures or objects, nor can they be detected by magical means, including {% spell_link see-invisibility %} or {% spell_link invisibility-purge %}. _Dust of appearance_, however, does reveal people and objects made invisible by _dust of disappearance_. Other factors, such as sound and smell, also allow possible detection__.

    The {% spell_link invisibility-greater %} bestowed by the dust lasts for {% die_roll 2 6 0 %} rounds.The invisible creature doesn't know when the duration will end.
