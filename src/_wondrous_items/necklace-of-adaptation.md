  description: |
    This necklace is a heavy chain with a platinum medallion. The magic of the necklace wraps the wearer in a shell of fresh air, making him immune to all harmful vapors and gases (such as {% spell_link cloudkill %} and {% spell_link stinking-cloud %} effects, as well as inhaled poisons) and allowing him to breathe, even underwater or in a vacuum.
