  description: |
    This skull, carved from ebony, is wholly evil. Wherever the skull goes, the area around it is treated as though an {% spell_link unhallow %} spell had been cast with the skull as the touched point of origin (except that no additional spell effect is tied or fixed to the _darkskull_).
