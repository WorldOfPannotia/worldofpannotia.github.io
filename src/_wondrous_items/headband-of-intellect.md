  description: |
    This device is a light cord with a small gem set so that it rests upon the forehead of the wearer. The headband adds to the wearer's Intelligence score in the form of an enhancement bonus of +2, +4, or +6. This enhancement bonus does not earn the wearer extra skill points when a new level is attained; use the unenhanced Intelligence bonus to determine skill points.
