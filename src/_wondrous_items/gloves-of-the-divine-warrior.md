  description: |
    These white leather gloves, when worn, aid a divine warrior in his quest for good. If the wearer is a paladin, he gains the ability to smite evil one additional time per day. Also, his lay on hands ability is calculated as if he had an additional five levels of paladin. If worn by a character who is not a paladin, they gain the lay on hands ability of a 5th level paladin and may smite evil once per day as a 5th level paladin. This effect only works if the wearer is neither chaotic nor evil.
