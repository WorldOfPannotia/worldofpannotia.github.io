  description: |
    This silvery-gray cloak seems to absorb light rather than be illuminated by it. On command, the cloak makes its wearer ethereal (as the {% spell_link ethereal-jaunt %} spell). The effect is dismissible. The cloak works for a total of up to 10 minutes per day. This duration need not be continuous.
