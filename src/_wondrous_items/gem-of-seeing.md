  description: |
    This finely cut and polished stone is indistinguishable from an ordinary jewel in appearance. When it is gazed through, a _gem of seeing_ enables the user to see as though she were affected by the {% spell_link true-seeing %} spell. A _gem of seeing_ can be used for as much as 30 minutes a day, divided up into periods of minutes or rounds as the user sees fit.
