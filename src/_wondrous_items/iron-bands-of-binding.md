  description: |
    When initially discovered, this very potent item appears to be a 3-inch-diameter rusty iron sphere with bandings on the globe.

    When the proper command word is spoken and the spherical iron device is hurled at an opponent, the bands expand and then contract to bind the target creature on a successful ranged touch attack. A single Large or smaller creature can be captured thus and held immobile until the command word is spoken to bring the bands into spherical form again. The creature can break (and ruin) the bands with a DC 30 Strength check or escape them with a DC 30 _escape artist_ check. _Iron bands of binding_ are usable once per day.
