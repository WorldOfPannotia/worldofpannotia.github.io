  description: |
    This substance provides a +20 competence bonus on all _escape artist_ checks, meaning that it is almost impossible to grapple such a character or to tie or chain him up. In addition, such obstructions as webs (magical or otherwise) do not affect an anointed individual. Magic ropes and the like do not avail against this salve. If it is smeared on a floor or on steps, the area should be treated as a long-lasting {% spell_link grease %} spell. The salve requires 8 hours to wear off normally, or it can be wiped off with an alcohol solution (even wine).

    _Salve of slipperiness_ is needed to coat the inside of a container that is meant to hold _sovereign glue_.
