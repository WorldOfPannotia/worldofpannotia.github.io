  description: |
    When this robe is put on, the wearer intuitively knows that the garment has very special properties. A _robe of blending_ enables its wearer to appear to be part of his surroundings. This allows him a +10 competence bonus on {% skill_link hide %} checks. The wearer can adopt the appearance of another creature, as with the {% spell_link disguise-self %} spell, at will. All creatures acquainted with and friendly to the wearer see him normally.
