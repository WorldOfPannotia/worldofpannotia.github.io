  description: |
    This well-made tome is always of small size, typically no more than 12 inches tall, 8 inches wide, and 1 inch thick. All such books are durable, waterproof, bound with iron overlaid with silver, and locked.

    A wizard can fill the 1,000 pages of a _blessed book_ with spells without paying the 100 gp per page material cost. This book is never found as randomly generated treasure with spells already inscribed in it.
