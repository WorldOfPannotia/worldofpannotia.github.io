  description: |
    This device appears to be a silver medallion in the shape of a beetle. If it is held for 1 round, an inscription appears on its surface letting the holder know that it is a protective device.

    The scarab's possessor gains spell resistance 20. The scarab can also absorb energy-draining attacks, death effects, and negative energy effects__. Upon absorbing twelve such attacks, the scarab turns to powder and is destroyed.
