  description: |
    This instrument can be struck once every 10 minutes, and its resonant tone lasts for 3 full minutes.

    While the chime is resonating, no spell requiring a verbal component can be cast within a 30-foot radius of it unless the caster can make a _concentration_ check (DC 15 + the spell's level).
