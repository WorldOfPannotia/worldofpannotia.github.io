  description: |
    Teleporting scroll cases are always made in pairs. Primarily used as communication between major cities or between military groups, these items have the ability to transport their contents between the two cases. When a scroll, or other similar item (such as a scroll carrying military orders) is placed into one case and the command word spoken, the contents are instantly transported to the second case in the pair. The receiving case will glow faintly from within, alerting its carrier that it has received something from the other case.

    This ability fails if the receiving case is not empty. In such a case, the item being transported simply stays in the originating case. The attempt still uses one of the charges for the cases, but as long as charges remain, the sender can attempt to send the scroll again.

    The cases can be used a combined total of 6 times per day.
