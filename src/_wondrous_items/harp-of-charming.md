  description: |
    This instrument is a golden, intricately carved harp. When played, it enables the performer to work one {% spell_link suggestion %} (as the spell, Will DC 14 negates) into the music for each 10 minutes of playing if he can succeed on a DC 14 _perform (string instruments)_ check. If the check fails, the audience cannot be affected by any further performances from the harpist for 24 hours.
