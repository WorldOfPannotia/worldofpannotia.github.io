  description: |
    This item appears to be a normal string of prayer beads until the owner casts a divine spell. Once that occurs, the owner instantly knows the powers of the prayer beads and how to activate them. Each strand includes two or more special beads, each with a different magic power.

    |---
    | Special Bead Type | Special Bead Ability
    |-|-
    | Bead of blessing | Wearer can cast {% spell_link bless %}.
    | Bead of healing | Wearer can cast his choice of {% spell_link cure-serious-wounds %}, {% spell_link remove-blindness-deafness %}, or {% spell_link remove-disease %}.
    | Bead of karma | Wearer casts his spells at +4 caster level. Effect lasts 10 minutes.
    | Bead of smiting | Wearer can cast {% spell_link chaos-hammer %}, {% spell_link holy-smite %}, {% spell_link orders-wrath %}, or {% spell_link unholy-blight %} (Will DC 17 partial).
    | Bead of summons | Summons a powerful creature of appropriate alignment from the Outer Planes (an angel, devil, etc.) to aid the wearer for one day. (If the wearer uses the _bead of summons_ to summon a deity's emissary frivolously, the deity takes that character's items and places a {% spell_link geasquest "geas" %} upon him as punishment in the very least.)
    | Bead of wind walking | Wearer can cast {% spell_link wind-walk %}.
    {: #prayer-beads-table .table .table-bordered .table-hover .table-striped data-caption="Table: Prayer Beads" }

    A _lesser strand of prayer beads_ has a _bead of blessing_ and a _bead of healing_. A _strand of prayer beads_ has a _bead of healing_, a _bead of karma_, and a _bead of smiting_. A _greater strand of prayer beads_ has a _bead of healing_, a _bead of karma_, a _bead of summons_, and a _bead of wind walking_.

    Each special bead can be used once per day, except for the _bead of summons_, which works only once and then becomes nonmagical. The _beads of blessing_, _smiting_, and _wind walking_ function as spell trigger items; the _beads of karma_ and _summons_ can be activated by any character capable of casting divine spells. The owner need not hold or wear the _strand of prayer beads_ in any specific location, as long as he carries it somewhere on his person.

    The power of a special bead is lost if it is removed from the strand. Reduce the price of a strand of prayer beads that is missing one or more beads by the following amounts: _bead of blessing_ -600 gp, _bead of healing_ -9,000 gp, _bead of karma_ -20,000 gp, _bead of smiting_ -16,800 gp, _bead of summons_ -20,000 gp, _bead of wind walking_ -46,800 gp.
