  description: |
    These crystalline stones always float in the air and must be within 3 feet of their owner to be of any use. When a character first acquires a stone, she must hold it and then release it, whereupon it takes up a circling orbit {% die_roll 1 3 0 %} feet from her head. Thereafter, a stone must be grasped or netted to separate it from its owner. The owner may voluntarily seize and stow a stone (to keep it safe while she is sleeping, for example), but she loses the benefits of the stone during that time. _Ioun stones_ have AC 24, 10 hit points, and hardness 5.

    Regeneration from the pearly white _ioun stone_ works like a _ring of regeneration_. (It only cures damage taken while the character is using the stone.) The pale lavender and lavender and green stones work like a _rod of absorption_, but absorbing a spell requires a readied action, and these stones cannot be used to empower spells. Stored spells in the vibrant purple stone must be placed by a spellcaster but can be used by anyone (see _ring of minor spell storing_).
