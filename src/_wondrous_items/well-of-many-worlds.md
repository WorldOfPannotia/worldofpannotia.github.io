  description: |
    This strange, interdimensional device looks just like a _portable hole_. Anything placed within it is immediately cast to another world &ndash; a parallel world, another planet, or a different plane (chosen randomly). If the well is moved, the random factor again comes into play. It can be picked up, folded, or rolled, just as a _portable hole_ can be. Objects from the world the well touches can come through the opening just as easily as from the initiating place. (It is a two-way portal.)
