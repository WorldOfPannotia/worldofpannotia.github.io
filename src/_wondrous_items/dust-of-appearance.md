  description: |
    This fine powder appears to be a very fine, very light metallic dust. A single handful of this substance flung into the air coats objects within a 10-foot radius, making them visible even if they are invisible. It likewise negates the effects of {% spell_link blur %} and {% spell_link displacement %}. (In this, it works just like the {% spell_link faerie-fire %} spell). The dust also reveals figments, {% spell_link mirror-image "mirror images" %}, and {% spell_link project-image "projected images" %} for what they are. A creature coated with the dust takes a -30 penalty on its {% skill_link hide %} checks. The dust's effect lasts for 5 minutes.

    _Dust of appearance_ is typically stored in small silk packets or hollow bone tubes.
