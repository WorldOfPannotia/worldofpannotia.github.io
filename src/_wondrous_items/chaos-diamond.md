  description: |
    This lustrous gemstone is uncut and about the size of a human fist. The gem grants its possessor the following powers:

     * {% spell_link confusion-lesser %}
     * {% spell_link magic-circle-against-law %}
     * {% spell_link word-of-chaos %}
     * {% spell_link cloak-of-chaos %}

    Each power is usable 1d4 times per day. This is rolled for each power individually and the character does not know the result.

    A nonchaotic character who possesses a _chaos diamond_ gains one negative level. Although this level never results in actual level loss, it remains as long as the diamond is in the character's possession and cannot be overcome in any way (including {% spell_link restoration %} spells).
