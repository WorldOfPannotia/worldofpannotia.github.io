  description: |
    These drums are kettle drums (hemispheres about 1&#189; feet in diameter on stands). They come in pairs and are unremarkable in appearance. If both of the pair are sounded, all creatures within 120 feet (with the exception of those within a 20-foot-radius safe zone around the drums) are affected as by a {% spell_link fear %} spell (Will DC 16 partial). _Drums of panic_ can be used once per day.
