  description: |
    This pale amber substance is thick and viscous. Because of its particular powers, it can be contained only in a flask whose inside has been coated with 1 ounce of _salve of slipperiness_, and each time any of the bonding agent is poured from the flask, a new application of the _salve of slipperiness_ must be put in the flask within 1 round to prevent the remaining glue from adhering to the side of the container. A flask of _sovereign glue_, when found, holds anywhere from 1 to 7 ounces of the stuff (1d8-1, minimum 1), with the other ounce of the flask's capacity taken up by the _salve of slipperiness_. One ounce of this adhesive covers 1 square foot of surface, bonding virtually any two substances together in a permanent union. The glue takes 1 round to set. If the objects are pulled apart (a move action) before that time has elapsed, that application of the glue loses its stickiness and is worthless. If the glue is allowed to set, then attempting to separate the two bonded objects has no effect, except when _universal solvent_ is applied to the bond. (_Sovereign glue_ is dissolved by _universal solvent_.)
