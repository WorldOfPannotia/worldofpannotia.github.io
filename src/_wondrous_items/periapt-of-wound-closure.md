  description: |
    This stone is bright red and dangles on a gold chain. The wearer of this periapt automatically becomes stable if his hit points drop to between -1 and -9 inclusive. The periapt doubles the wearer's normal rate of healing or allows normal healing of wounds that would not do so normally. Hit point damage that involves bleeding is negated for the wearer of the periapt, but he is still susceptible to damage from bleeding that causes Constitution loss, such as that dealt by a wounding weapon.
