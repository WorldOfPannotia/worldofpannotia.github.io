  description: |
    This 6-inch-wide, 1-inch-high perforated golden vessel resembles a thurible found in a place of worship. If it is filled with incense and lit, summoning words spoken over it summon forth a Large air elemental. The summoning words require 1 full round to speak. In all ways the censer functions as the {% spell_link summon-monster-vi %} spell. If _incense of meditation_ is burned within the censer, the air elemental is an elder air elemental instead (as if {% spell_link summon-monster-ix %} had just been cast). Only one elemental can be summoned at a time. A new elemental requires a new piece of incense, which cannot be lit until after the first elemental disappears (is dispelled, dismissed, or slain).
