  description: |
    This rug is able to fly through the air as if affected by an {% spell_link overland-flight %} spell of unlimited duration. The size, carrying capacity, and speed of the different _carpets of flying_ are shown on the table below. Beautifully and intricately made, each carpet has its own command word to activate it &ndash; if the device is within voice range, the command word activates it, whether the speaker is on the rug or not. The carpet is then controlled by spoken directions.

    A _carpet of flying_ can carry up to double its capacity, but doing so reduces its speed to 30 feet. It has average maneuverability, but a _carpet of flying_ can still hover.
