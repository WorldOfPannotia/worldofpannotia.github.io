  description: |
    This item is fashioned from carnelian. Each of the six sides of the cube is keyed to a plane, one of which is the Material Plane. The character creating the item should choose the planes to which the other five sides are keyed.

    If a side of the _cubic gate_ is pressed once, it opens a {% spell_link gate %} to a random point on the plane keyed to that side. There is a 10% chance per minute that an outsider from that plane (determine randomly) comes through it looking for food, fun, or trouble. Pressing the side a second time closes the {% spell_link gate %}. It is impossible to open more than one {% spell_link gate %} at a time.

    If a side is pressed twice in quick succession, the character so doing is transported to a random point on the other plane, along with all creatures in adjacent squares. (The other creatures may avoid this fate by succeeding on DC 23 Will saves).
