  description: |
    This strange elixir bestows upon the drinker the ability to spit gouts of flame. He can breathe fire up to three times, each time dealing {% die_roll 4 6 0 %} points of fire damage to a single target up to 25 feet away. The victim can attempt a DC 13 Reflex save for half damage. Unused blasts dissipate 1 hour after the liquid is consumed.
