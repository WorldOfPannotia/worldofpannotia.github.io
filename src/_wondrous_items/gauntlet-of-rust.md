  description: |
    This single metal gauntlet looks rusted and pitted but is actually quite powerful. Once per day, it can affect an object as with the {% spell_link rusting-grasp %} spell. It also completely protects the wearer and her gear from rust (magical or otherwise), including the attack of a rust monster.
