  description: |
    A stone of this nature is typically an oddly shaped bit of roughly polished rock.

    The possessor of such a stone need but utter a few words of summoning, and a Huge earth elemental comes to the summoner. The summoning words require 1 full round to speak, and in all ways the stone functions as the {% spell_link summon-monster-vii %} spell. (If sand or rough, unhewn stone is the summoning medium, the elemental that comes is Large instead, and the stone functions as the {% spell_link summon-monster-vi %} spell.) The elemental appears in {% die_roll 1 4 0 %} rounds. Only one elemental can be summoned at a time. A new elemental requires a new patch of earth or stone, which cannot be accessed until after the first elemental disappears (is dispelled, dismissed, or slain).
