  description: |
    This crystal appears to be a long, rough prism. Upon utterance of a command word, the crystal emits bright light of one of three sorts.

     * One command word causes the gem to shed light as a hooded lantern. This use of the gem does not expend any charges.
     * Another command word causes the _gem of brightness_ to send out a bright ray 1 foot in diameter and 50 feet long. This strikes as a ranged touch attack, and any creature struck by this beam is blinded for 1d4 rounds unless it makes a DC 14 Fortitude save. This use of the gem expends 1 charge.
     * The third command word causes the gem to flare in a blinding flash of light that fills a 30-foot cone. Although this glare lasts but a moment, any creature within the cone must make a DC 14 Fortitude save or be blinded for 1d4 rounds. This use expends 5 charges.

    A newly created _gem of brightness_ has 50 charges. When all its charges are expended, the gem becomes nonmagical.
