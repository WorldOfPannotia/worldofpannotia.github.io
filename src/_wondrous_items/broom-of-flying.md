  description: |
    This broom is able to fly through the air as if affected by an {% spell_link overland-flight %} spell (average maneuverability) for up to 9 hours per day (split up as its owner desires). The broom can carry 200 pounds and fly at a speed of 40 feet, or up to 400 pounds at a speed at 30 feet. In addition, the broom can travel alone to any destination named by the owner as long as she has a good idea of the location and layout of that destination. It comes to its owner from as far away as 300 yards when she speaks the command word. The _broom of flying_ has a speed of 40 feet when it has no rider.
