  description: |
    This white tallow candle, when burned, calls into place a {% spell_link zone-of-truth %} spell (Will DC 13 negates) in a 5-foot radius centered on the candle. The zone lasts for 1 hour, as the candle burns. If the candle is snuffed before that time, the effect is canceled and the candle ruined.
