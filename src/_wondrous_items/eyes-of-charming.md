  description: |
    These two crystal lenses fit over the user's eyes. The wearer is able to use {% spell_link charm-person %} (one target per round) merely by meeting a target's gaze. Those failing a DC 16 Will save are _charmed_ as per the spell. If the wearer has only one lens, the DC of the saving throw is reduced to 10.
