  description: |
    A _chime of opening_ is a hollow mithral tube about 1 foot long. When struck, it sends forth magical vibrations that cause locks, lids, doors, valves, and portals to open. The device functions against normal bars, shackles, chains, bolts, and so on. A _chime of opening_ also automatically dispels a {% spell_link hold-portal %} spell or even an {% spell_link arcane-lock %} cast by a wizard of lower than 15th level.

    The chime must be pointed at the item or gate to be loosed or opened (which must be visible and known to the user). The chime is then struck, a clear tone rings forth, and in 1 round the target lock is unlocked, the shackle is loosed, the secret door is opened, or the lid of the chest is lifted. Each sounding only opens one form of locking, so if a chest is chained, padlocked, locked, and {% spell_link arcane-lock "arcane locked" %}, it takes four uses of a _chime of opening_ to get it open. A {% spell_link silence %} spell negates the power of the device. A brand-new chime can be used a total of ten times before it cracks and becomes useless.
