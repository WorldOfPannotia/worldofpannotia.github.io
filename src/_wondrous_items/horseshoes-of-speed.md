  description: |
    These iron shoes come in sets of four like ordinary horseshoes. When affixed to an animal's hooves, they increase the animal's base land speed by 30 feet; this counts as an enhancement bonus. As with other effects that increase speed, jumping distances increase proportionally. All four shoes must be worn by the same animal for the magic to be effective.
