    This sweet-tasting liquid causes the character drinking it to become _charmed_ with the first creature she sees after consuming the draft (as {% spell_link charm-person %} &ndash; the drinker must be a humanoid of Medium or smaller size, Will DC 14 negates). The _charm_ effects wear off in {% die_roll 1 3 0 %} hours.
