  description: |
    If the stopper is removed from this ordinary-looking flask and a command word spoken, an amount of fresh or salt water pours out. Separate command words determine the type as well as the volume and velocity.

     * "Stream" pours out 1 gallon per round.
     * "Fountain" produces a 5-foot-long stream at 5 gallons per round.
     * "Geyser" produces a 20-foot-long, 1-foot-wide stream at 30 gallons per round.

    The geyser effect causes considerable back pressure, requiring the holder to make a DC 12 Strength check to avoid being knocked down. The force of the geyser deals {% die_roll 1 4 0 %} points of damage but can only affect one target per round. The command word must be spoken to stop it.
