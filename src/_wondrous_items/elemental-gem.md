  description: |
    This gem contains a conjuration spell attuned to a specific Elemental Plane (Air, Earth, Fire, or Water).

    When the gem is crushed, smashed, or broken (a standard action), a Large elemental appears as if summoned by a _summon nature's ally_ spell. The elemental is under the control of the creature that broke the gem.

    The coloration of the gem varies with the type of elemental it summons. _Air elemental gems_ are transparent, _earth elemental gems_ are light brown, _fire elemental gems_ are reddish orange, and _water elemental gems_ are blue-green.
