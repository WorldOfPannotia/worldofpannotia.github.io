  description: |
    The _staff of power_ is a very potent magic item, with offensive and defensive abilities. It is usually topped with a glistening gem, its shaft straight and smooth. It has the following powers:

     * {% spell_link magic-missile %} (1 charge)
     * {% spell_link ray-of-enfeeblement %} (heightened to 5th level) (1 charge)
     * {% spell_link continual-flame %} (1 charge)
     * {% spell_link levitate %} (1 charge)
     * {% spell_link lightning-bolt %} (heightened to 5th level) (1 charge)
     * {% spell_link fireball %} (heightened to 5th level) (1 charge)
     * {% spell_link cone-of-cold %} (2 charges)
     * {% spell_link hold-monster %} (2 charges)
     * {% spell_link wall-of-force %} (in a 10-ft.-diameter hemisphere around the caster only) (2 charges)
     * {% spell_link globe-of-invulnerability %} (2 charges)

    The wielder of a _staff of power_ gains a +2 luck bonus to AC and saving throws. The staff is also a _+2 quarterstaff %}", and its wielder may use it to smite opponents. If 1 charge is expended (as a free action), the staff causes double damage (&times;3 on a critical hit) for 1 round.

    A _staff of power_ can be used for a retributive strike, requiring it to be broken by its wielder. (If this breaking of the staff is purposeful and declared by the wielder, it can be performed as a standard action that does not require the wielder to make a Strength check.) All charges currently in the staff are instantly released in a 30-foot radius. All within 2 squares of the broken staff take points of damage equal to 8 &times; the number of charges in the staff, those 3 or 4 squares away take 6 &times; the number of charges in damage, and those 5 or 6 squares distant take 4 &times; the number of charges in damage. All those affected can make DC 17 Reflex saves to reduce the damage by half.

    The character breaking the staff has a 50% chance of traveling to another plane of existence, but if he does not, the explosive release of spell energy destroys him. Only certain items, including the _staff of the magi_ and the _staff of power %}", are capable of being used for a retributive strike.

    After all charges are used up from the staff, it remains a _+2 quarterstaff_. (Once empty of charges, it cannot be used for a retributive strike.)
