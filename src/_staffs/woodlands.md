  description: |
    Appearing to have grown naturally into its shape, this oak, ash, or yew staff allows use of the following spells:

     * {% spell_link charm-animal %} (1 charge)
     * {% spell_link speak-with-animals %} (1 charge)
     * {% spell_link barkskin %} (2 charges)
     * {% spell_link wall-of-thorns %} (3 charges)
     * {% spell_link summon-natures-ally-vi %} (3 charges)
     * {% spell_link animate-plants %} (4 charges)

    The staff may be used as a weapon, functioning as a _+2 quarterstaff_. The _staff of the woodlands_ also allows its wielder to {% spell_link pass-without-trace %} at will, with no charge cost. These two attributes continue to function after all the charges are expended.
