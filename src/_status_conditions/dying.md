title: "Dying"

condition:
  description: |
    A dying character is unconscious and near death. She has fewer than 0 current hit points. A dying character can take no actions and is unconscious. At the end of each round (starting with the round in which the character dropped below 0 hit points), the character rolls d% to see whether she becomes stable. She has a 10% chance to become stable. If she does not, she loses 1 hit point. If a dying character reaches her [negative hit point threshold]({{ site.url }}/game-rules/adventuring/combat/injury-death/#loss-of-hit-points), she is dead.
