title: "Confused"

condition:
  description: |
    A _confused_ character's actions are determined by rolling d% at the beginning of his turn: 01-10, attack caster with melee or ranged weapons (or close with caster if attacking is not possible); 11-20, act normally; 21-50, do nothing but babble incoherently; 51-70, flee away from caster at top possible speed; 71-100, attack nearest creature (for this purpose, a familiar counts as part of the subject's self ). A _confused_ character who can't carry out the indicated action does nothing but babble incoherently. Attackers are not at any special advantage when attacking a _confused_ character. Any _confused_ character who is attacked automatically attacks its attackers on its next turn, as long as it is still _confused_ when its turn comes. A _confused_ character does not make attacks of opportunity against any creature that it is not already devoted to attacking (either because of its most recent action or because it has just been attacked).
