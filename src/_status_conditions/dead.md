title: "Dead"

condition:
  description: |
    The character's hit points are reduced to his [negative hit point threshold]({{ site.url }}/game-rules/adventuring/combat/injury-death/#loss-of-hit-points), his Constitution drops to 0, or he is killed outright by a spell or effect. The character's soul leaves his body. Dead characters cannot benefit from normal or magical healing, but they can be restored to life via magic. A dead body decays normally unless magically preserved, but magic that restores a dead character to life also restores the body either to full health or to its condition at the time of death (depending on the spell or device). Either way, resurrected characters need not worry about rigor mortis, decomposition, and other conditions that affect dead bodies.
