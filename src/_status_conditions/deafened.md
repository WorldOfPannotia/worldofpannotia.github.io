title: "Deafened"

condition:
  description: |
    A deafened character cannot hear. She takes a -4 penalty on initiative checks, automatically fails {% skill_link listen %} checks, and has a 20% chance of spell failure when casting spells with verbal components. Characters who remain deafened for a long time grow accustomed to these drawbacks and can overcome some of them.
