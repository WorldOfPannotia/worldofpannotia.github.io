          At 1st level, a martial artist gains Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat. A martial artist's attacks may be with either fist interchangeably or even from elbows, knees, and feet. This means that a martial artist may even make unarmed strikes with his hands full. There is no such thing as an off-hand attack for a martial artist striking unarmed. A martial artist may thus apply his full Strength bonus on damage rolls for all his unarmed strikes.

          Usually a martial artist's unarmed strikes deal lethal damage, but he can choose to deal nonlethal damage instead with no penalty on his attack roll. He has the same choice to deal lethal or nonlethal damage while grappling.

          A martial artist's unarmed strike is treated both as a manufactured weapon and a natural weapon for the purpose of spells and effects that enhance or improve either manufactured weapons or natural weapons.

          A martial artist deals damage with his unarmed strike based on his size category. A medium sized martial artist has a base damage of 1d6 plus any Strength bonus he may have. Some disciplines may increase this base damage, but it does not increase in level as a monk's damage does. See the monk class for the damage dealt by small or large martial artists. The base damage is equal to a 1st level monk.

          _Special:_ Some disciplines will increase the amount of damage a martial artist deals with his unarmed strike. Each time this is increased, use the table below for the martial artist's damage.

          | Increase | New Damage

          | 1st | 1d8

          At all levels except those divisible by 3 (3rd, 6th, 9th, etc), the martial artist gains a new discipline. This can be an advancement in a martial style that he has already begun studying, or the martial artist may opt to begin studying a new style of martial art. At no time is a martial artist able to select a level of a style more than one level beyond his current degree of study in that particular style. For example, Itharun is a 12th level martial artist. When he gains 13th level, he can choose to advance to the next degree in a discipline he has already begun studying, or he may begin a new discipline at it's first degree.
