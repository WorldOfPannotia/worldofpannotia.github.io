  description: |
    You perceive what the subject creature perceives using its sight, hearing, taste, or smell. Only one sense is linked, and you cannot switch between senses with the same manifestation.

    You make any skill checks involving senses, such as Spot or Listen, as the subject, and only within the subject's field of view. You lose your Dexterity bonus to AC while directly sensing what the subject senses.

    Once sense link is manifested, the link persists even if the subject moves out of the range of the original manifestation (but the link does not work across planes). You do not control the subject, nor can you communicate with it by means of this power.

    The strength of the subject's linked sense could be enhanced by other powers or items, allowing you the same enhanced sense. You are subject to any gaze attack affecting the subject creature (if you linked vision). If you are blinded or deafened, or suffer some other sensory deprivation, the linked creature functions as an independent sensory organ, and provides you the benefit of the linked sense from its perspective while this power's duration lasts.
  augment: |
    You can augment this power in one or both of the following ways.

    1. If you spend 2 additional power points, you can have the subject perceive one of your senses instead of the other way around.
    1. If you spend 4 additional power points, you can link to a second sense of the same subject.
