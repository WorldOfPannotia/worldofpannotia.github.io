  description: |
    You partially wipe your victim's mind of past experiences, bestowing two negative levels upon it. If the subject has at least as many negative levels as Hit Dice, it dies. For each negative level it gains, a psionic creature loses knowledge of one power from its highest available level, and a number of power points from its maximum power point total sufficient to manifest that power. The effects of multiple negative levels stack.

    If the subject survives, it loses these two negative levels after 1 hour. (No Fortitude save is necessary to avoid gaining the negative level permanently.)
  augment: |
    You can manifest this power in one or both of the following ways.

    1. For every 2 additional power points you spend, this power's save DC increases by 1.
    1. For every 3 additional power points you spend, this power bestows an additional negative level on the subject.
