  description: |
    You forge a psychometabolic affinity with an idealized animal form, thereby boosting one of your ability scores (choose either Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma). The power grants a +4 enhancement bonus to the ability score you choose, adding the usual benefits provided by a high ability bonus. Because you are emulating the idealized form of an animal, you also take on minor aspects of the animal you choose. If you choose to increase the ability you use to manifest powers, you do not gain the benefit of an increased ability score long enough to gain any bonus power points for a high ability score, but the save DCs of your powers increase for the duration of this power.
  augment: |
    For every 5 additional power points you spend, this power grants a +4 enhancement bonus to another ability.
