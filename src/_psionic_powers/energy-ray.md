  description: |
    Upon manifesting this power, you choose cold, electricity, fire, or sonic. You create a ray of energy of the chosen type that shoots forth from your fingertip and strikes a target within range, dealing {% die_roll 1 6 0 %} points of damage, if you succeed on a ranged touch attack with the ray.

    Cold: A ray of this energy type deals +1 point of damage per die.

    Electricity: Manifesting a ray of this energy type provides a +3 bonus on your attack roll if the target is wearing metal armor and a +2 bonus on manifester level checks for the purpose of overcoming power resistance.

    Fire: A ray of this energy type deals +1 point of damage per die.

    Sonic: A ray of this energy type deals -1 point of damage per die and ignores an object's hardness.

    This power's subtype is the same as the type of energy you manifest.
