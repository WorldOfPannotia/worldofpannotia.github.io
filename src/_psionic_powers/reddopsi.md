  description: |
    When you manifest reddopsi, powers targeted against you rebound to affect the original manifester. This effect reverses powers that have only you as a target (except dispel psionics and similar powers or effects). Powers that affect an area and those that produce effects can't be reversed. Reddopsi also can't reverse any power with a range of touch.

    Should you rebound a power back against a manifester who also is protected by reddopsi, the power rebounds once more upon you.
