  description: |
    You can excite the structure of a nonpsionic, nonmagical object, heating it to the point of combustion over time. The agitation grows more intense in the second and third rounds after you manifest the power, as described below.

    1st Round: Readily flammable material (paper, dry grass, tinder, torches) ignites. Skin reddens (1 point of damage).

    2nd Round: Wood smolders and smokes, metal becomes hot to the touch, skin blisters ({% die_roll 1 4 0 %} points of damage), hair smolders, paint shrivels, water boils.

    3rd and Subsequent Rounds: Wood ignites, metal scorches ({% die_roll 1 4 0 %} points of damage for those holding metallic objects). Skin burns and hair ignites ({% die_roll 1 6 0 %} points of damage), lead melts.
