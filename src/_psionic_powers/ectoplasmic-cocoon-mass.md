  description: |
    As ectoplasmic cocoon, except you can cocoon several creatures (or a single big creature that fits in a 20-foot radius sphere or hemisphere) in a mass of writhing ectoplasm. Targets entirely within the area who fail their save are caught and cocooned. If a creature's body is only partially within the area, this power does not affect that creature.

    For every 2 additional power points you spend, the radius of this power's area increases by 5 feet.
