  description: |
    Your body assimilates some of the effect of an energy attack and converts it to harmless light. You gain resistance 10 against any attack that deals acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic damage.

    When you absorb damage, you can choose to radiate visible light that illuminates a 60-foot radius for a number of rounds equal to the points of damage you successfully resisted, or merely dissipate the energy without giving off a visual display.

    The energy resistance provided by this power increases to 20 points at 9th manifester level and to a maximum of 30 points at 13th level. The power protects your equipment as well.

    The resistance provided by this power does not stack with other forms of energy resistance.

    This power's subtype is the same as the type of damage it protects against.
  augment: |
    If you spend 4 additional power points, you can manifest this power as an immediate action.
