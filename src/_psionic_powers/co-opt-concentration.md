  description: |
    You take over control of a power that was manifested by the subject and that must be maintained through concentration. Once you wrest control of the power from the subject, you have several options.

     * Allow the power to function as normal.
     * Keep the power targeted on the subject (if a personal power) but decide how the power fulfills its function each round.
     * Retarget the power on yourself (if a personal power).
     * Choose not to concentrate on the co-opted power in the next round, ending the power at that point.

    When the duration of co-opt concentration expires, the power you took control of ends (even if this would mean that the power ends earlier than normal).
