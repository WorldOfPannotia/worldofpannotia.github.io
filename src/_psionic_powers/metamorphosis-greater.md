  description: |
    As metamorphosis, except that this power enables you to assume the form of any single nonunique object or creature (of any type) from Fine to Colossal size. The assumed form cannot have more Hit Dice than your manifester level (to a maximum of 25 HD). Unlike metamorphosis, this power allows incorporeal, ectoplasmic, or gaseous forms to be assumed.

    You gain all extraordinary and supernatural abilities (both special attacks and special qualities) of the assumed form, but you lose your own supernatural abilities. You also gain the type of the new form (for example, dragon or magical beast) in place of your own. The new form does not disorient you. Parts of your body or pieces of equipment that are separated from you do not revert to their original form.

    You can become just about anything you are familiar with. You can change form once each round as a swift action

    The change takes place either immediately before your regular action or immediately after it, but not during the action.

    If you use this power to create a disguise, you get a +10 bonus on your Disguise check.

    As an inanimate object, you lose all mobility; however, you retain your ability to manifest powers normally.
