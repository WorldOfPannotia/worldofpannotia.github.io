  description: |
    All the subject's memories and knowledge are accessible to you, from memories deep below the surface to those still easily called to mind. You can learn the answer to one question per round, to the best of the subject's knowledge. If the subject succeeds on a Will save, it is not required to answer the question; however, making a save does not end the power. You can ask the subject a new question (or the same question) in subsequent rounds for as long as the power's duration persists.

    You can probe a sleeping subject and automatically get an answer to your question. If the subject then succeeds on a Will save, it wakes after providing the answer and thereafter can resist answering by making Will saves as described above.

    Subjects that do not wish to be probed can attempt to move beyond the power's range, unless they are somehow hindered. You pose the questions telepathically, and the answers to those questions are imparted directly to your mind. You and the subject do not need to speak the same language, though less intelligent creatures may yield up only appropriate visual images in answer to your questions.
