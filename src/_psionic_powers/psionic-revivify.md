  description: |
    Psionic revivify lets a manifester reconnect a corpse's psyche with its body, restoring life to a recently deceased creature. The power must be manifested within 1 round of the victim's death. Before the psyche of the deceased has completely left the body, this power halts its journey while repairing somewhat the damage to the body.

    This power functions like the raise dead spell, except that the affected creature receives no level loss, no Constitution loss, and no loss of powers.

    The creature has -1 hit points (but is stable) after being restored to life.
  xpCost: 200
  augment: |
    For every 100 additional experience points that both you and the subject pay, the manifestation of this power can be delayed by 1 additional round.
