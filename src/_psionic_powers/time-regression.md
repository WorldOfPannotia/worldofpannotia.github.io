  description: |
    You can regress apparent time 1 round into the past. In effect, you "replay" the previous round of activity. The power regresses time to the point along the time stream just prior to your previous turn, undoing the effects of everyone else's actions in the meantime. Once you have used time regression, only you retain knowledge of what happened during the round that is being replayed; however, you can communicate that knowledge verbally to your companions, if desired. During the round that you live through a second time, you can act on knowledge you previously gained by already living through the immediate future. In all likelihood, you'll probably not choose to manifest time regression during your second pass through the time stream, instead taking completely new actions, but you pay the XP cost all the same.
