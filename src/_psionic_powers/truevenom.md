  description: |
    If you have a claw attack (either from an actual natural weapon or from an effect such as claws of the beast), you can use this power to produce a horrible poison that coats one of your claws. On your next successful melee attack with the claw during the power's duration, the poison deals {% die_roll 1 8 0 %} points of Constitution damage immediately and another {% die_roll 1 8 0 %} points of Constitution damage 1 minute later. The target of your attack can negate each instance of damage with a Fortitude save.
