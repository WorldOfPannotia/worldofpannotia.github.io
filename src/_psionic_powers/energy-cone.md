  description: |
    Upon manifesting this power, you choose cold, electricity, fire, or sonic. You create a cone of energy of the chosen type, extending outward from your hand, that deals 5d6 points of damage to every creature or object within the area.

    Cold: A cone of this energy type deals +1 point of damage per die. The saving throw to reduce damage from a cold cone is a Fortitude save instead of a Reflex save.

    Electricity: Manifesting a cone of this energy type provides a +2 bonus to the save DC and a +2 bonus on manifester level checks for the purpose of overcoming power resistance.

    Fire: A cone of this energy type deals +1 point of damage per die.

    Sonic: A cone of this energy type deals -1 point of damage per die and ignores an object's hardness.

    This power's subtype is the same as the type of energy you manifest.
  augment: |
    For every additional power point you spend, this power's damage increases by one die (d6). For each extra two dice of damage, this power's save DC increases by 1.
