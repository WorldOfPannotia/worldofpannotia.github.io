  description: |
    Upon manifesting this power, you choose cold, electricity, fire, or sonic. You weave a field of potential energy of the chosen type around your body. The first successful attack made against you in each round during the power's duration prompts a response from the field with out any effort on your part. The attack may be physical, the effect of a power, or the effect of a spell (including spell-like, supernatural, and extraordinary abilities). An "ectoburst" discharges from the field, targeting the source of the attack and dealing 4d6 points of damage of the chosen energy type. To be affected, a target must be within close range, you must have line of sight and line of effect to it, and you must be able to identify the source of the attack. The ectoburst is a ranged touch attack made using your base attack bonus plus your key ability modifier for your manifesting class.

    Cold: A field of this energy type deals +1 point of damage per die. The saving throw to reduce damage from a cold retort is a Fortitude save instead of a Reflex save.

    Electricity: Manifesting a field of this energy type provides a +2 bonus to the save DC and a +2 bonus on manifester level checks for the purpose of overcoming power resistance.

    Fire: A field of this energy type deals +1 point of damage per die.

    Sonic: A field of this energy type deals -1 point of damage per die and ignores an object's hardness.

    This power's subtype is the same as the type of energy you manifest.

    For every additional power point you spend, this power's duration increases by 1 minute.
