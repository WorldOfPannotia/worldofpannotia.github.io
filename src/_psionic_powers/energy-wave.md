  description: |
    Upon manifesting this power, you choose cold, electricity, fire, or sonic. You create a flood of energy of the chosen type out of unstable ectoplasm that deals {% die_roll 13 6 0 %} points of damage to each creature and object in the area. This power originates at your hand and extends outward in a cone.

    Cold: A wave of this energy type deals +1 point of damage per die. The saving throw to reduce damage from a cold wave is a Fortitude save instead of a Reflex save.

    Electricity: Manifesting a wave of this energy type provides a +2 bonus to the save DC and a +2 bonus on manifester level checks for the purpose of overcoming power resistance.

    Fire: A wave of this energy type deals +1 point of damage per die.

    Sonic: A wave of this energy type deals -1 point of damage per die and ignores an object's hardness.

    This power's subtype is the same as the type of energy you manifest.
  augment: |
    For every additional power point you spend, this power's damage increases by one die (d6). For each extra two dice of damage, this power's save DC increases by 1.
