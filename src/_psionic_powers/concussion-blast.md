    A subject you select is pummeled with telekinetic force for {% die_roll 1 6 0 %} points of force damage. You can choose to have the power deal an equal amount of nonlethal damage instead. Concussion blast always affects a subject within range that you can see, even if the subject is in melee or has cover or concealment (you cannot use this power against creatures with total cover or total concealment).

    Nonmagical, unattended objects (including doors, walls, locks, and so on) may also be damaged by this power.
