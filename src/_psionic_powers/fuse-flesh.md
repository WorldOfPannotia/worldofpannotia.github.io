  description: |
    You cause the touched subject's flesh to ripple, grow together, and fuse into a nearly seamless whole. The subject is forced into a fetal position (if humanoid), with only the vaguest outline of its folded arms and legs visible below the all-encompassing wave of flesh. The subject retains the ability to breathe, eat, and excrete, but may lose the use of its senses (see below). If the sudden transformation would prove fatal to the creature (such as fusing a swimming airbreathing subject, or a flying subject), the subject gets a +4 bonus on the save. Unless it loses the use of its senses (see below), the creature can still perform purely mental actions, such as manifesting powers.

    If the target fails its Fortitude save to avoid the power's effect, the subject must immediately attempt a second Fortitude save. If this second save is failed, the creature's eyes and ears fuse over, effectively blinding and deafening it. Moreover, it loses its extraordinary, supernatural, and spell-like abilities, as well as its ability to manifest powers (if any), and is generally in sorry shape.

    Incorporeal or gaseous creatures and creatures not composed of flesh are immune to fuse flesh, and a shapechanger can revert to its unfused form as a standard action.
