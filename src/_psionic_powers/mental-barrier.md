  description: |
    You project a field of improbability around yourself, creating a fleeting protective shell. You gain a +4 deflection bonus to Armor Class.

    You can manifest this power instantly, quickly enough to gain its benefits in an emergency. Manifesting the power is an immediate action. You can use this power even when it's not your turn; however, you must manifest it prior to an opponent's attack roll in order to gain this power's benefit against that attack.

    1. If you spend 4 additional power points, the deflection bonus to Armor Class increases by 1.
    1. For every additional power point you spend, this power's duration increases by 1 round.
