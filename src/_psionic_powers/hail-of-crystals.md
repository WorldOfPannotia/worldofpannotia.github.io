  description: |
    A tiny ectoplasmic crystal emanates from your outstretched hand and rapidly expands to a 2-foot-diameter ball of crystal as it speeds toward the location you designate. You can choose to aim this crystal at a single target or at a specific point in space (a grid intersection).

    If you aim the crystal at a single target, you must make a ranged touch attack to strike the target. Any creature or object struck by the ball of crystal takes {% die_roll 5 4 0 %} points of bludgeoning damage.

    Whether the crystal hits its target, misses, or was aimed at a point in space, it explodes upon arrival at the location you designated. Anyone within 20 feet of the explosion takes {% die_roll 9 4 0 %} points of slashing damage from the thousands of crystal shards that spray forth.
  augment: |
    For every additional power point you spend, this power's damage from the explosion of the crystal increases by {% die_roll 1 4 0 %} points.
