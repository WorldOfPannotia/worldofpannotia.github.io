  description: |
    A psionic lock manifested upon a door, chest, or portal psionically locks it. You can freely pass your own lock without affecting it; otherwise, a door or object secured with psionic lock can be opened only by breaking in or by a successful dispel psionics effect. Add +10 to the normal DC to break open a door or portal affected by this power.
