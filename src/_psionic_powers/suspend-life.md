  description: |
    You can place yourself into a trance so deep that you are almost in suspended animation. Even powers that detect life or thought are incapable of determining that you are alive.

    While you are suspended, you are aware of your surroundings. You feel the passage of one day for every year that actually passes. Though on a slower schedule, you grow hungry after a "day" without food (though a year passes in actuality) and begin to suffer the effects of thirst and starvation as appropriate.

    If you take any damage, you come out of your trance 4 rounds later. The trance can also be ended by a successful use of dispel psionics. If you choose to dismiss the power, your trance ends 10 rounds later.
