plane:
  type: "inner"
  description: |
    The Elemental Plane of Earth is a solid place made of rock, soil, and stone. An unwary and unprepared traveler may find himself entombed within this vast solidity of material and have his life crushed into nothingness, his powdered remains a warning to any foolish enough to follow.

    Despite its solid, unyielding nature, the Elemental Plane of Earth is varied in its consistency, ranging from relatively soft soil to veins of heavier and more valuable metal.

    The Elemental Plane of Earth has the following traits.

     * Earth-dominant.
     * Enhanced magic. Spells and spell-like abilities that use, manipulate, or create earth or stone (including those of the {% domain_link earth %} domain) are both empowered and extended (as if the Empower Spell and Extend Spell metamagic feats had been used on them, but the spells don't require higher-level slots). Spells and spell-like abilities that are already empowered or extended are unaffected by this benefit.
     * Impeded magic. Spells and spell-like abilities that use or create air (including spells of the {% domain_link air %} domain and spells that summon air elementals or outsiders with the air subtype) are impeded.
