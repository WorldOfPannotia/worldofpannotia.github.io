  description: |
    This cabinet has the ability to produce a feast for up to forty people, three times per day. Merely opening the doors of the cabinet reveals platters of food of all types and flavors of the very freshest sort. The meal has all the qualities and benefits of that produced by a _heroes' feast_ spell.
