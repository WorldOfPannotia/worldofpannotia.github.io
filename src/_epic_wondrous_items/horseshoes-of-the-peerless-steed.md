These horseshoes magically adhere to the feet of any hoofed creature. Anyone riding the creature gains a +10 competence bonus on Ride checks and is treated as having ranks in the appropriate Ride skill (and thus does not take the -5 penalty for riding an unfamiliar mount). The horseshoes grant the creature (or its rider, as appropriate) the effects of the Trample, Ride-By Attack, and Spirited Charge feats. The wearer of the horseshoes gains spell resistance 32 against enchantment effects. In addition, the ground speed of the creature wearing the horseshoes doubles.
Craft Wondrous Item, Craft Epic Wondrous Item, Ride skill, {% spell_link haste %}, {% spell_link spell-resistance %}; _Market Price:_ 217,000 gp; _Weight:_ 1 lb. each.
