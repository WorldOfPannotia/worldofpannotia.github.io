  description: |
    These horseshoes magically adhere to the feet of any hoofed creature. Anyone riding the creature gains a +10 competence bonus on Ride checks and is treated as having ranks in the appropriate Ride skill (and thus does not take the -5 penalty for riding an unfamiliar mount). The horseshoes grant the creature (or its rider, as appropriate) the effects of the Trample, Ride-By Attack, and Spirited Charge feats. The wearer of the horseshoes gains spell resistance 32 against enchantment effects. In addition, the ground speed of the creature wearing the horseshoes doubles.
