  description: |
    These shoes grant their wearer a +6 enhancement bonus to Dexterity. The wearer's speed doubles (this does not stack with any magical or supernatural enhancement to speed), he or she gains the evasion ability (as the rogue class feature), and the wearer's jumping distance is not limited by his or her height. The wearer gains a +20 competence bonus on Balance, Climb, Jump, and Tumble checks. Three times per day, the wearer can utter a command word to activate the boots' {% spell_link haste %} power (as the {% spell_link haste %} spell, lasts 20 rounds).
