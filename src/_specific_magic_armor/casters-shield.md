  description: |
    This _+1 light wooden shield_ has a small leather strip on the back on which a spellcaster can scribe a single spell as on a scroll. A spell so scribed has only half the base raw material cost. Experience point and component costs remain the same. The strip cannot accommodate spells of higher than 3rd level. The strip is reusable.

    A random _caster's shield_ has a 50% chance of having a single medium scroll spell on it. The spell is divine (01-80 on d%) or arcane (81-100).

    A _caster's shield_ has a 5% arcane spell failure chance.
