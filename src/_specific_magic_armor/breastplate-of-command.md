<p id="breastplate-of-command">**Breastplate of Command:** This finely crafted _+2 breastplate_ radiates a powerful aura of magic. When worn, the armor bestows a dignified and commanding aura upon its owner. The wearer gains a +2 competence bonus on all Charisma checks, including turning checks and Charisma-based skill checks. The wearer also gains a +2 competence bonus to his Leadership score. Friendly troops within 360 feet of the user become braver than normal. Since the effect arises in great part from the distinctiveness of the armor, the wearer cannot hide or conceal herself in any way and still have the effect function.
Strong enchantment; CL 15th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, _mass charm monster_; Price 25,400 gp; Cost 10,975 gp + 850 XP.
