  description: |
    This bright silver or gold _+3 chainmail_ is so fine and light that it can be worn under normal clothing without betraying its presence. It has a maximum Dexterity bonus of +8, an armor check penalty of -2, and an arcane spell failure chance of 15%. It is considered light armor, weighs 20 pounds, and it allows the wearer to use {% spell_link fly %} on command (as the spell) once per day.
