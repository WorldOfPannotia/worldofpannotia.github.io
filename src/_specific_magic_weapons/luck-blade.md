This _+2 short sword_ gives its possessor a +1 luck bonus on all saving throws. Its possessor also gains the power of good fortune, usable once per day. This extraordinary ability allows its possessor to reroll one roll that she just made. She must take the result of the reroll, even if it's worse than the original roll. In addition, a _luck blade_ may contain up to three _wishes_ (when randomly rolled, a _luck blade_ holds 1d4-1 _wishes_, minimum 0). When the last _wish_ is used, the sword remains a _+2 short sword_, still grants the +1 luck bonus, and still grants its reroll power.
; Price 22,060 gp (0 _wishes_), 62,360 gp (1 _wish_), 102,660 gp (2 _wishes_), 142,960 gp (3 _wishes_); Cost 11,030 gp + 882 XP (0 _wishes_), 31,180 gp + 2,494 XP (1 _wish_); 51,330 gp + 4,106 XP (2 _wishes_), 71,480 gp + 5,718 XP (3 _wishes_).
