  description: |
    This _+2 short sword_ gives its possessor a +1 luck bonus on all saving throws. Its possessor also gains the power of good fortune, usable once per day. This extraordinary ability allows its possessor to reroll one roll that she just made. She must take the result of the reroll, even if it's worse than the original roll. In addition, a _luck blade_ may contain up to three {% spell_link wish 'Wishes' %} (when randomly rolled, a _luck blade_ holds {% die_roll 1 4 0 %}-1 {% spell_link wish 'Wishes' %}, minimum 0). When the last {% spell_link wish %} is used, the sword remains a _+2 short sword_, still grants the +1 luck bonus, and still grants its reroll power.
