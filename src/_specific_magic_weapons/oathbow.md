Of elven make, this white _+2 composite longbow_ (+2 Str bonus) whispers "Swift defeat to my enemies" in Elven when nocked and pulled. Once per day, if the firer swears aloud to slay her target (a free action), the bow's whisper becomes the low shout "Swift death to those who have wronged me." Against such a sworn enemy, the bow has a +5 enhancement bonus, and arrows launched from it deal an additional 2d6 points of damage (and &times;4 on a critical hit instead of the normal &times;3). However, the bow is treated as only a masterwork weapon against all foes other than the sworn enemy, and the wielder takes a -1 penalty on attack rolls with any weapon other than the _oathbow_. These bonuses and penalties last for seven days or until the sworn enemy is slain or destroyed by the wielder of the _oathbow_, whichever comes first.
The _oathbow_ may only have one sworn enemy at a time. Once the wielder swears to slay a target, he cannot make a new oath until he has slain that target or seven days have passed. Even if the wielder slays the sworn enemy on the same day that he makes the oath, he cannot activate the _oathbow_'s special power again until 24 hours have passed from the time he made the oath.
; Price 25,600 gp; Cost 13,100 gp + 1,000 XP.
