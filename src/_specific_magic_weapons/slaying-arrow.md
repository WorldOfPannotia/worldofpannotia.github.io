<p id="slaying-arrow"><strong>Slaying Arrow:</strong> This <em>+1 arrow</em> is keyed to a particular type or subtype of creature. If it strikes such a creature, the target must make a DC 20 Fortitude save or die (or, in the case of unliving targets, be destroyed) instantly. Note that even creatures normally exempt from Fortitude saves (undead and constructs) are subject to this attack. When keyed to a living creature, this is a death effect (and thus <em>death ward</em> protects a target). To determine the type or subtype of creature the arrow is keyed to, roll on <a href="#bane-enemies-table">Table: Bane Enemies</a> above.
A <em>greater slaying arrow</em> functions just like a normal <em>slaying arrow</em>, but the DC to avoid the death effect is 23.
Strong necromancy; CL 13th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, <em>finger of death</em> (<em>slaying arrow</em>) or heightened <em>finger of death</em> (<em>greater slaying arrow</em>); Price 2,282 gp (<em>slaying arrow</em>) or 4,057 gp (<em>greater slaying arrow</em>); Cost 1,144 gp 5 sp + 91 XP (<em>slaying arrow</em>) or 2,032 gp + 162 XP (<em>greater slaying arrow</em>).
