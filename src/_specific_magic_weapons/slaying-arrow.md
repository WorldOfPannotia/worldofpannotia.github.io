This _+1 arrow_ is keyed to a particular type or subtype of creature. If it strikes such a creature, the target must make a DC 20 Fortitude save or die (or, in the case of unliving targets, be destroyed) instantly. Note that even creatures normally exempt from Fortitude saves (undead and constructs) are subject to this attack. When keyed to a living creature, this is a death effect (and thus _death ward_ protects a target). To determine the type or subtype of creature the arrow is keyed to, roll on <a href="#bane-enemies-table">Table: Bane Enemies</a> above.
A _greater slaying arrow_ functions just like a normal _slaying arrow_, but the DC to avoid the death effect is 23.
; Price 2,282 gp (_slaying arrow_) or 4,057 gp (_greater slaying arrow_); Cost 1,144 gp 5 sp + 91 XP (_slaying arrow_) or 2,032 gp + 162 XP (_greater slaying arrow_).
