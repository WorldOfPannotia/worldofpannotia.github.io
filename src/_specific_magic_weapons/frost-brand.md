This _+3 frost greatsword_ sheds light as a torch when the temperature drops below 0&deg;F. At such times it cannot be concealed when drawn, nor can its light be shut off. Its wielder is protected from fire; the sword absorbs the first 10 points of fire damage each round that the wielder would otherwise take.
A _frost brand_ extinguishes all nonmagical fires in its area. As a standard action, it can also dispel lasting fire spells, but not instantaneous effects, though you must succeed on a dispel check (1d20 +14) against each spell to dispel it. The DC to dispel such spells is 11 + the caster level of the fire spell.
; Price 54,475 gp; Cost 27,375 gp and 5 sp + 2179 XP.
