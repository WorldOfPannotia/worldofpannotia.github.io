<p id="nine-lives-stealer"><strong>Nine Lives Stealer:</strong> This longsword always performs as a <em>+2 longsword</em>, but it also has the power to draw the life force from an opponent. It can do this nine times before the ability is lost. At that point, the sword becomes a simple <em>+2 longsword</em> (with a hint of evil about it). A critical hit must be dealt for the sword's death-dealing ability to function, and this weapon has no effect on creatures not subject to critical hits. The victim is entitled to a DC 20 Fortitude save to avoid death. If the save is successful, the sword's death-dealing ability does not function, no use of the ability is expended, and normal critical damage is determined. This sword is evil, and any good character attempting to wield it gains two negative levels. These negative levels remain as long as the sword is in hand and disappear when the sword is no longer wielded. These negative levels never result in actual level loss, but they cannot be overcome in any way (including <em>restoration</em> spells) while the sword is wielded.
Strong necromancy [evil]; CL 13th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, <em>finger of death</em>; Price 23,057 gp; Cost 11,528 gp 5 sp + 922 XP.
