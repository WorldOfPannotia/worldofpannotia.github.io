  description: |
    A weapon of this type enables its wielder to determine the location, depth, kind, and number of aquatic predators within 680 feet. A _trident of warning_ must be grasped and pointed in order for the character using it to gain such information, and it requires 1 round to scan a hemisphere with a radius of 680 feet. The weapon is otherwise a _+2 trident_.
