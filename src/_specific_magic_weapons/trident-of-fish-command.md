  description: |
    The magical properties of this _+1 trident_ with a 6-foot-long haft enable its wielder to {% spell_link charm-animal 'charm' %} up to 14 HD of aquatic animals (Will DC 16 negates, animals get a +5 bonus if currently under attack by the wielder or his allies), no two of which can be more than 30 feet apart. The wielder can use this effect up to three times per day. The wielder can communicate with the animals as if using a {% spell_link speak-with-animals %} spell. Animals making their saving throw are free of control, but they will not approach within 10 feet of the trident. The trident can be used up to three times per day.
