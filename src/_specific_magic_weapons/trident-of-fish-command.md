The magical properties of this _+1 trident_ with a 6-foot-long haft enable its wielder to _charm_ up to 14 HD of aquatic animals (Will DC 16 negates, animals get a +5 bonus if currently under attack by the wielder or his allies), no two of which can be more than 30 feet apart. The wielder can use this effect up to three times per day. The wielder can communicate with the animals as if using a _speak with animals_ spell. Animals making their saving throw are free of control, but they will not approach within 10 feet of the trident. The trident can be used up to three times per day.
; Price 18,650 gp; Cost 9,325 gp + 746 XP.
