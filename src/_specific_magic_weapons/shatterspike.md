  description: |
    Wielders without the {% feat_link improved-sunder %} feat use _Shatterspike_ as a _+1 longsword_ only; wielders with the {% feat_link improved-sunder %} feat add a +4 bonus (including the sword's +1 enhancement bonus) to the opposed roll when attempting to strike a foe's weapon. If successful, _Shatterspike_ deals 1d8+4 points of damage plus the wielder's Strength modifier to the target weapon (the target weapon's hardness must still be overcome with each hit). _Shatterspike_ can damage weapons with an enhancement bonus of +4 or lower.
