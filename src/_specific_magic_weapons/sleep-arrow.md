This _+1 arrow_ is painted white and has white fletching. If it strikes a foe so that it would normally deal damage, it instead bursts into magical energy that deals nonlethal damage (in the same amount as would be lethal damage) and forces the target to make a DC 11 Will save or fall asleep.
; Price 132 gp; Cost 69 gp 5 sp + 5 XP.
