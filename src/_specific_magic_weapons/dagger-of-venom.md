This black _+1 dagger_ has a serrated edge. It allows the wielder to use a _poison_ effect (as the spell, save DC 14) upon a creature struck by the blade once per day. The wielder can decide to use the power after he has struck. Doing so is a free action, but the _poison_ effect must be invoked in the same round that the dagger strikes.
; Price 8,302 gp; Cost 4,302 gp + 320 XP.
