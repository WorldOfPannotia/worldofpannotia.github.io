  description: |
    This black _+1 dagger_ has a serrated edge. It allows the wielder to use a {% spell_link poison %} effect (as the spell, save DC 14) upon a creature struck by the blade once per day. The wielder can decide to use the power after he has struck. Doing so is a free action, but the {% spell_link poison %} effect must be invoked in the same round that the dagger strikes.
