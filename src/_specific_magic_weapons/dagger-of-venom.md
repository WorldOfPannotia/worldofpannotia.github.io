<p id="dagger-of-venom"><strong>Dagger of Venom:</strong> This black <em>+1 dagger</em> has a serrated edge. It allows the wielder to use a <em>poison</em> effect (as the spell, save DC 14) upon a creature struck by the blade once per day. The wielder can decide to use the power after he has struck. Doing so is a free action, but the <em>poison</em> effect must be invoked in the same round that the dagger strikes.
Faint necromancy; CL 5th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, <em>poison</em>; Price 8,302 gp; Cost 4,302 gp + 320 XP.
