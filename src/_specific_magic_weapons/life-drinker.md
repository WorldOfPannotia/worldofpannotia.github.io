This _+1 greataxe_ is favored by undead and constructs, who do not suffer its drawback. A _life-drinker_ bestows two negative levels on its target whenever it deals damage, just as if its target had been struck by an undead creature. One day after being struck, subjects must make a DC 16 Fortitude save for each negative level or lose a character level.
Each time a _life-drinker_ deals damage to a foe, it also bestows one negative level on the wielder. Any negative level gained by the wielder in this fashion lasts for 1 hour.
; Price 40,320 gp; Cost 20,320 gp + 1,600 XP.
