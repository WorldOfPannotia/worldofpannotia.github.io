  description: |
    On command, this _+2 heavy mace_ causes the wielder's clothes and appearance to transform into an illusion of darkest horror such that living creatures in a 30-foot cone become panicked as if by a {% spell_link fear %} spell (Will DC 16 partial). They take a -2 morale penalty on saving throws, and they flee from the wielder. The wielder may use this ability up to three times per day.
