<p id="mace-of-terror"><strong>Mace of Terror:</strong> On command, this <em>+2 heavy mace</em> causes the wielder's clothes and appearance to transform into an illusion of darkest horror such that living creatures in a 30-foot cone become panicked as if by a <em>fear</em> spell (Will DC 16 partial). They take a -2 morale penalty on saving throws, and they flee from the wielder. The wielder may use this ability up to three times per day.
Strong necromancy; CL 13th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, <em>fear</em>; Price 38,552 gp; Cost 19,276 gp + 1,542 XP.
