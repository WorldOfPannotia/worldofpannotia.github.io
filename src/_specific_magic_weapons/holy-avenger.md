  description: |
    This _+2 cold iron longsword_ becomes a _+5 holy cold iron longsword_ in the hands of a paladin.

    It provides spell resistance of 5 + the paladin's level to the wielder and anyone adjacent to her. It also enables the wielder to use {% spell_link dispel-magic-greater %} (once per round as a standard action) at the class level of the paladin. (Only the area dispel is possible, not the targeted dispel or counterspell versions of {% spell_link dispel-magic-greater %}.)
