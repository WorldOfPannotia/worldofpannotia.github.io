This _+2 cold iron longsword_ becomes a _+5 holy cold iron longsword_ in the hands of a paladin.
It provides spell resistance of 5 + the paladin's level to the wielder and anyone adjacent to her. It also enables the wielder to use _greater dispel magic_ (once per round as a standard action) at the class level of the paladin. (Only the area dispel is possible, not the targeted dispel or counterspell versions of _greater dispel magic_.)
