        <ul class="racialTraits">
            <li>+2 Strength, -2 Intelligence, -2 Charisma.
                <ul>
                    <li>A half-orc's starting Intelligence score is always at least 3. If this adjustment would lower the character's score to 1 or 2, his score is nevertheless 3.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Medium: As Medium creatures, half-orcs have no special bonuses or penalties due to their size.</li>
            <li>Half-orc base land speed is 30 feet.</li>
            <li>Darkvision: Half-orcs (and orcs) can see in the dark up to 60 feet. Darkvision is black and white only, but it is otherwise like normal sight, and half-orcs can function just fine with no light at all.</li>
            <li>Orc Blood: For all effects related to race, a half-orc is considered an orc.</li>
            <li>Automatic Languages: Common and Orc. Bonus Languages: Draconic, Giant, Gnoll, Goblin, and Abyssal.</li>
            <li>Favored Class: Barbarian. A multiclass half-orc's barbarian class does not count when determining whether he takes an experience point penalty.</li>
