        <h4>Racial Traits</h4>
        <ul class="racialTraits">
            <li>+2 Constitution, -2 Strength.</li>
            <li>Small: As a Small creature, a gnome gains a +1 size bonus to Armor Class, a +1 size bonus on attack rolls, and a +4 size bonus on <em>hide</em> checks, but he uses smaller weapons than humans use, and his lifting and carrying limits are three-quarters of those of a Medium character.</li>
            <li>Gnome base land speed is 20 feet.</li>
            <li>Low-Light Vision: A gnome can see twice as far as a human in starlight, moonlight, torchlight, and similar conditions of poor illumination. He retains the ability to distinguish color and detail under these conditions.</li>
            <li>Weapon Familiarity: Gnomes may treat gnome hooked hammers as martial weapons rather than exotic weapons.</li>
            <li>+2 racial bonus on saving throws against illusions.</li>
            <li>Add +1 to the Difficulty Class for all saving throws against illusion spells cast by gnomes. This adjustment stacks with those from similar effects.</li>
            <li>+1 racial bonus on attack rolls against kobolds and goblinoids.</li>
            <li>+4 dodge bonus to Armor Class against monsters of the giant type. Any time a creature loses its Dexterity bonus (if any) to Armor Class, such as when it's caught flat-footed, it loses its dodge bonus, too.</li>
            <li>+2 racial bonus on <em>listen</em> checks.</li>
            <li>+2 racial bonus on <em>craft (alchemy)</em> checks.</li>
            <li>Automatic Languages: Common and Gnome. Bonus Languages: Draconic, Dwarven, Elven, Giant, Goblin, and Orc. In addition, a gnome can speak with a burrowing mammal (a badger, fox, rabbit, or the like, see below). This ability is innate to gnomes. See the <em>speak with animals</em> spell description.</li>
            <li>Spell-Like Abilities: 1/day&ndash;<em>speak with animals</em> (burrowing mammal only, duration 1 minute). A gnome with a Charisma score of at least 10 also has the following spell-like abilities: 1/day&ndash;<em>dancing lights</em>, <em>ghost sound</em>, <em>prestidigitation</em>. Caster level 1st; save DC 10 + gnome's Cha modifier + spell level.</li>
            <li>Favored Class: Bard. A multiclass gnome's bard class does not count when determining whether he takes an experience point penalty.</li>
