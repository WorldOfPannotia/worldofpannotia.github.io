        <p>Your mind generates a tangible field of force that provides a +4 armor bonus to Armor Class. Unlike mundane armor, inertial armor entails no armor check penalty or speed reduction. Because inertial armor is composed of psychokinetic force, incorporeal creatures can't bypass it the way they do normal armor.</p>
        <p>Your inertial armor can be invisible or can appear as a colored glow, at your option.</p>
        <p>The armor bonus provided by inertial armor does not stack with the armor bonus provided by regular armor.</p>
        <p><strong>Augment:</strong> For every 2 additional power points you spend, the armor bonus to Armor Class increases by 1.</p>
