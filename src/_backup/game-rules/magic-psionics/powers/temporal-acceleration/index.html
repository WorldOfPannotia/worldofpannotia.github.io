        <p><strong>Level:</strong> Psion/Wilder 6</p>
        <p><strong>Display:</strong> None</p>
        <p><strong>Manifesting Time:</strong> 1 swift action</p>
        <p><strong>Range:</strong> Personal</p>
        <p><strong>Target:</strong> You</p>
        <p><strong>Duration:</strong> 1 round (in apparent time); see text</p>
        <p><strong>Power Points:</strong> 11</p>
        <p>You enter another time frame, speeding up so greatly that all other creatures seem frozen, though they are actually still moving at normal speed. You are free to act for 1 round of apparent time. You can manifest powers, cast spells, move, or perform other types of actions, subject to the restrictions outlined below.</p>
        <p>While your temporal acceleration is in effect, other creatures are invulnerable to your attacks and powers. This means you cannot target a creature with any attack or power. However, a power you manifest that affects an area and has a duration longer than the remaining duration of your temporal acceleration has its normal effect on creatures in the area once this power ends.</p>
        <p>You can affect an unattended object but not an object held, carried, or worn by another creature. You are undetectable by any means while your temporal acceleration lasts.</p>
        <p>While under the effect of this power, you cannot enter an area protected by a null psionics field or by a power or spell that neutralizes high-level powers or spells. Normal and magical fire, cold, acid, and the like can still harm you.</p>
        <p>When your temporal acceleration expires, you resume acting during your current turn in the standard time frame. You are shaken for 1 round upon your return to the standard time frame.</p>
        <p>Splintered or partitioned minds within your own mind, such as might be in effect through the use of powers such as schism, are not temporally speeded up, even if your second mind manifested this power (your primary mind gains the benefit, while your second mind remains stuck in the standard time frame).</p>
        <p>Manifesting this power is a swift action You cannot manifest this power when it isn't your turn.</p>
        <p><strong>Augment:</strong> For every 4 additional power points you spend, this power's duration (in apparent time) increases by 1 round.</p>
