        <p><em>Telepathy [Mind-Affecting]</em></p>
        <p><strong>Level:</strong> Psion/Wilder 2</p>
        <p><strong>Display:</strong> Mental</p>
        <p><strong>Manifesting Time:</strong> 1 standard action</p>
        <p><strong>Range:</strong> 20 ft.</p>
        <p><strong>Target:</strong> One psionic creature</p>
        <p><strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</p>
        <p><strong>Saving Throw:</strong> None</p>
        <p><strong>Power Resistance:</strong> No</p>
        <p><strong>Power Points:</strong> 3</p>
        <p>You link your mind with another psionic creature's mind, creating a brief conduit through which mental energy can be shared. When you manifest this power, the subject gains up to 2 power points. You can transfer only as many power points to a subject as it has manifester levels.</p>
        <p>Because of the intimate nature of this power, it cannot be fabricated into a psionic item-only power points generated by a psionic creature in the moment can be shared using bestow power.</p>
        <p><strong>Augment:</strong> For every 3 additional power points you spend, the subject gains 2 additional power points.</p>
