        <p><strong>Level:</strong> Psion/Wilder 7, Psychic Warrior 3</p>
        <p><strong>Display:</strong> Material</p>
        <p><strong>Manifesting Time:</strong> 1 immediate action</p>
        <p><strong>Range:</strong> Personal</p>
        <p><strong>Target:</strong> You</p>
        <p><strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</p>
        <p><strong>Power Points:</strong> Psion/Wilder 13, Psychic Warrior 5</p>
        <p>You throw off a faux ectoplasmic shell, allowing you to slide out of range of a damaging effect. When you manifest this power in conjunction with making a successful Reflex save against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, you instead take no damage.</p>
        <p>You can manifest this power with an instant thought, quickly enough to save yourself if you unexpectedly come within range of a dangerous effect. Manifesting this power is an immediate action. You can even manifest this power when it isn't your turn.</p>
        <p><strong>Augment:</strong> If you spend 4 additional power points, you take only half damage on a failed Reflex save.</p>
