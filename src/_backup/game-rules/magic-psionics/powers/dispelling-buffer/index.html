        <p><em>Psychokinesis</em></p>
        <p><strong>Level:</strong> Kineticist 6, Psychic Warrior 6</p>
        <p><strong>Display:</strong> Material and olfactory</p>
        <p><strong>Manifesting Time:</strong> 1 standard action</p>
        <p><strong>Range:</strong> Personal or close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels); see text</p>
        <p><strong>Target:</strong> You or one willing creature or one object (object weighing up to 100 lb./level); see text</p>
        <p><strong>Duration:</strong> 1 hour/level (D)</p>
        <p><strong>Saving Throw:</strong> None</p>
        <p><strong>Power Resistance:</strong> Yes (harmless, object)</p>
        <p><strong>Power Points:</strong> 11</p>
        <p>You create a psychokinetic shield around the subject that improves the chance that any powers affecting the subject will resist a dispel psionics power (or a dispel magic spell) or a negation effect that targets a specific power (such as shatter mind blank). When dispelling buffer is manifested on a creature or object, add +5 to the DC of the dispel check for each ongoing effect that is subject to being dispelled.</p>
        <p>Dispel psionics can negate dispelling buffer, but against a targeted dispel, dispelling buffer is always checked last (with the same +5 bonus). Against an area dispel, dispelling buffer is checked in the order according to its level (with the same +5 bonus).</p>
        <p>Special: When a Psychic Warrior manifests this power, the range is personal and the target is the manifester.</p>
