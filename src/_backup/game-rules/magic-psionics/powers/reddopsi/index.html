        <p><strong>Level:</strong> Kineticist 7</p>
        <p><strong>Display:</strong> Auditory, mental, and olfactory</p>
        <p><strong>Manifesting Time:</strong> 1 standard action</p>
        <p><strong>Range:</strong> Personal</p>
        <p><strong>Target:</strong> You</p>

        <p><strong>Power Points:</strong> 13</p>
        <p>When you manifest reddopsi, powers targeted against you rebound to affect the original manifester. This effect reverses powers that have only you as a target (except dispel psionics and similar powers or effects). Powers that affect an area and those that produce effects can't be reversed. Reddopsi also can't reverse any power with a range of touch.</p>
        <p>Should you rebound a power back against a manifester who also is protected by reddopsi, the power rebounds once more upon you.</p>
