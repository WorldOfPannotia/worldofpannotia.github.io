        <p>You restore a severed extremity to a creature that has lost a digit, hand, arm, leg, or even its head. This power does not restore life, but it returns a lost extremity to a living or dead creature if the creature is otherwise mostly intact. The original extremity need not be present when this power is manifested; a new extremity is created by the power. If a head is restored to a body, the original head (if not already destroyed) loses all spark of identity, and can be considered so much dead tissue.</p>
