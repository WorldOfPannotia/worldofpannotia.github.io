        <p>Your limited omniscience allows you to reroll a saving throw, attack roll, or skill check. Whatever the result of the reroll, you must use it even if it is worse than the original roll.</p>
        <p>You can manifest this power instantly, quickly enough to gain its benefits in an emergency. Manifesting this power is an immediate action. If you use the power to reroll a saving throw, you can manifest this power even when it is not your turn.</p>
