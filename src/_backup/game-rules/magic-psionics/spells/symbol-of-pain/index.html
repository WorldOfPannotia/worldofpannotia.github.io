        <p><em>Necromancy [Evil]</em></p>
        <p><strong>Level:</strong> Clr 5, Sor/Wiz 5</p>
        <p>This spell functions like symbol of death, except that each creature within the radius of a symbol of pain instead suffers wracking pains that impose a -4 penalty on attack rolls, skill checks, and ability checks. These effects last for 1 hour after the creature moves farther than 60 feet from the symbol.</p>
        <p>Unlike symbol of death, symbol of pain has no hit point limit; once triggered, a symbol of pain simply remains active for 10 minutes per caster level.</p>
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> Magic traps such as symbol of pain are hard to detect and disable. A rogue (only) can use the Search skill to find a symbol of pain and Disable Device to thwart it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 30 for symbol of pain.</p>
        <p><em>Material Component:</em> Mercury and phosphorus, plus powdered diamond and opal with a total value of at least 1,000 gp.</p>
