        <p><strong>Level:</strong> Brd 2, Clr 2</p>

        <p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 standard action</p>
        <p><strong>Range:</strong> Long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)</p>
        <p><strong>Area:</strong> 20-ft.-radius emanation centered on a creature, object, or point in space</p>
        <p><strong>Duration:</strong> 1 min./level (D)</p>

        <p><strong>Spell Resistance:</strong> Yes; see text or no (object)</p>
        <p>Upon the casting of this spell, complete silence prevails in the affected area. All sound is stopped: Conversation is impossible, spells with verbal components cannot be cast, and no noise whatsoever issues from, enters, or passes through the area. The spell can be cast on a point in space, but the effect is stationary unless cast on a mobile object. The spell can be centered on a creature, and the effect then radiates from the creature and moves as it moves. An unwilling creature can attempt a Will save to negate the spell and can use spell resistance, if any. Items in a creature's possession or magic items that emit sound receive the benefits of saves and spell resistance, but unattended objects and points in space do not. This spell provides a defense against sonic or language-based attacks.</p>
