        <p>This spell causes the target humanoid creature to shrink, reducing its height by three quarters and dividing its weight by 16. This reduces the creature's size category by two steps. The target gains a +8 size bonus to Dexterity, a -4 size penalty to Strength (to a minimum of 1), and a +3 bonus on attack rolls and AC due to its decreased size.</p>
        <p>All equipment the creature is holding or carrying is shrunk in a similar fashion. Melee and projectile weapons affected by this spell deal less damage. Other magical properties a weapon or item may have are unaffected, however. Any reduced item that leaves a reduced creature's possession (including a projectile or thrown weapon) instantly returns to its normal size. This means that thrown weapons deal their normal damage, and projectiles deal damage based on the size of the weapon that fired them.</p>
        <p>Multiple magical effects that reduce size do not stack.</p>

        <p><em>Material Component:</em> A pinch of powdered iron and a handful of weed killer.</p>
