        <p><strong>Level:</strong> Drd 4</p>
        <p><strong>Cleric Domains:</strong> Earth 4</p>
        <p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, DF</p>
        <p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 standard action</p>
        <p><strong>Range:</strong> Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)</p>
        <p><strong>Area:</strong> One 20-ft. square/level</p>
        <p><strong>Duration:</strong> 1 hour/level (D)</p>
        <p><strong>Saving Throw:</strong> Reflex partial</p>
        <p><strong>Spell Resistance:</strong> Yes</p>
        <p>Rocky ground, stone floors, and similar surfaces shape themselves into long, sharp points that blend into the background.</p>
        <p>Spike stones impede progress through an area and deal damage. Any creature moving on foot into or through the spell's area moves at half speed.</p>
        <p>In addition, each creature moving through the area takes 1d8 points of piercing damage for each 5 feet of movement through the spiked area.</p>
        <p>Any creature that takes damage from this spell must also succeed on a Reflex save to avoid injuries to its feet and legs. A failed save causes the creature's speed to be reduced to half normal for 24 hours or until the injured creature receives a cure spell (which also restores lost hit points). Another character can remove the penalty by taking 10 minutes to dress the injuries and succeeding on a Heal check against the spell's save DC.</p>
        <p>Spike stones is a magic trap that can't be disabled with the Disable Device skill.</p>
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> Magic traps such as spike stones are hard to detect. A rogue (only) can use the Search skill to find spike stones. The DC is 25 + spell level, or DC 29 for spike stones.</p>
