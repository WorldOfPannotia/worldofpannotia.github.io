        <p>This spell frees victims from enchantments, transmutations, and curses. Break enchantment can reverse even an instantaneous effect. For each such effect, you make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level, maximum +15) against a DC of 11 + caster level of the effect. Success means that the creature is free of the spell, curse, or effect. For a cursed magic item, the DC is 25.</p>
        <p>If the spell is one that cannot be dispelled by dispel magic, break enchantment works only if that spell is 5th level or lower.</p>
        <p>If the effect comes from some permanent magic item break enchantment does not remove the curse from the item, but it does frees the victim from the item's effects.</p>
