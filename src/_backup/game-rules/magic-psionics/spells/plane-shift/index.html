        <p><em>Conjuration (Teleportation)</em></p>
        <p><strong>Level:</strong> Clr 5, Sor/Wiz 7</p>
        <p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, F</p>
        <p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 standard action</p>
        <p><strong>Range:</strong> Touch</p>
        <p><strong>Target:</strong> Creature touched, or up to eight willing creatures joining hands</p>
        <p><strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</p>
        <p><strong>Saving Throw:</strong> Will negates</p>
        <p><strong>Spell Resistance:</strong> Yes</p>
        <p>You move yourself or some other creature to another plane of existence or alternate dimension. If several willing persons link hands in a circle, as many as eight can be affected by the plane shift at the same time. Precise accuracy as to a particular arrival location on the intended plane is nigh impossible. From the Material Plane, you can reach any other plane, though you appear 5 to 500 miles (5d%) from your intended destination.</p>
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> Plane shift transports creatures instantaneously and then ends. The creatures need to find other means if they are to travel back.</p>
        <p><em>Focus:</em> A small, forked metal rod. The size and metal type dictates to which plane of existence or alternate dimension the spell sends the affected creatures.</p>
