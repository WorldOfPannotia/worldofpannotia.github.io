        <p><em>Enchantment (Compulsion) [Language-Dependent, Mind-Affecting]</em></p>
        <p><strong>Level:</strong> Brd 6, Clr 6, Sor/Wiz 6</p>
        <p><strong>Cleric Domains:</strong> Charm 6, Nobility 6</p>
        <p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 10 minutes</p>
        <p><strong>Target:</strong> One living creature</p>
        <p><strong>Saving Throw:</strong> None</p>
        <p>This spell functions similarly to lesser geas, except that it affects a creature of any HD and allows no saving throw.</p>
        <p>Instead of taking penalties to ability scores (as with lesser geas), the subject takes 3d6 points of damage each day it does not attempt to follow the geas/quest. Additionally, each day it must make a Fortitude saving throw or become sickened. These effects end 24 hours after the creature attempts to resume the geas/quest.</p>
        <p>A remove curse spell ends a geas/quest spell only if its caster level is at least two higher than your caster level. Break enchantment does not end a geas/quest, but limited wish, miracle, and wish do.</p>
        <p>Bards, sorcerers, and wizards usually refer to this spell as geas, while clerics call the same spell quest.</p>
