        <p>This spell causes an object to radiate shadowy illumination out to a 20-foot radius. All creatures in the area gain concealment (20% miss chance). Even creatures that can normally see in such conditions (such as with darkvision or low-light vision) have the miss chance in an area shrouded in magical darkness.</p>
        <p>Normal lights (torches, candles, lanterns, and so forth) are incapable of brightening the area, as are light spells of lower level. Higher level light spells are not affected by darkness.</p>
        <p>If darkness is cast on a small object that is then placed inside or under a lightproof covering, the spell's effect is blocked until the covering is removed.</p>
        <p>Darkness counters or dispels any light spell of equal or lower spell level.</p>
        <p><em>Arcane Material Component:</em> A bit of bat fur and either a drop of pitch or a piece of coal.</p>
