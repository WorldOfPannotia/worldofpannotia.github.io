        <p><em>Conjuration (Teleportation)</em></p>
        <p><strong>Level:</strong> Sor/Wiz 9</p>
        <p><strong>Cleric Domains:</strong> Rune 9</p>
        <p><strong>Components:</strong> V, M</p>
        <p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 10 minutes</p>
        <p><strong>Range:</strong> 0 ft.</p>
        <p><strong>Effect:</strong> 5-ft.-radius circle that teleports those who activate it</p>
        <p><strong>Duration:</strong> 10 min./level (D)</p>
        <p><strong>Saving Throw:</strong> None</p>
        <p><strong>Spell Resistance:</strong> Yes</p>
        <p>You create a circle on the floor or other horizontal surface that teleports, as greater teleport, any creature who stands on it to a designated spot. Once you designate the destination for the circle, you can't change it. The spell fails if you attempt to set the circle to teleport creatures into a solid object, to a place with which you are not familiar and have no clear description, or to another plane.</p>
        <p>The circle itself is subtle and nearly impossible to notice. If you intend to keep creatures from activating it accidentally, you need to mark the circle in some way.</p>
        <p>Teleportation circle can be made permanent with a permanency spell. A permanent teleportation circle that is disabled becomes inactive for 10 minutes, then can be triggered again as normal.</p>
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> Magic traps such as teleportation circle are hard to detect and disable. A rogue (only) can use the Search skill to find the circle and Disable Device to thwart it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 34 in the case of teleportation circle.</p>
        <p><em>Material Component:</em> Amber dust to cover the area of the circle (cost 1,000 gp).</p>
