        <p>This spell functions like arcane sight, except that you automatically know which spells or magical effects are active upon any individual or object you see.</p>
        <p>Greater arcane sight doesn't let you identify magic items.</p>
        <p>Unlike arcane sight, this spell cannot be made permanent with a permanency spell.</p>
