        <p>You cause an object or location to emanate magical vibrations that repel either a specific kind of intelligent creature or creatures of a particular alignment, as defined by you. The kind of creature to be affected must be named specifically. A creature subtype is not specific enough. Likewise, the specific alignment to be repelled must be named.</p>
        <p>Creatures of the designated kind or alignment feel an overpowering urge to leave the area or to avoid the affected item.</p>
        <p>A compulsion forces them to abandon the area or item, shunning it and never willingly returning to it while the spell is in effect. A creature that makes a successful saving throw can stay in the area or touch the item but feels uncomfortable doing so. This distracting discomfort reduces the creature's Dexterity score by 4 points.</p>
        <p>Antipathy counters and dispels sympathy.</p>
        <p><em>Arcane Material Component:</em> A lump of alum soaked in vinegar.</p>
