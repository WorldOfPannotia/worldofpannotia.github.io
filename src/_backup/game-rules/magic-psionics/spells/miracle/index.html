        <p><em>Evocation</em></p>
        <p><strong>Level:</strong> Clr 9</p>
        <p><strong>Cleric Domains:</strong> Luck 9</p>
        <p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, XP; see text</p>
        <p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 standard action</p>
        <p><strong>Range:</strong> See text</p>
        <p><strong>Target, Effect, or Area: </strong> See text</p>
        <p><strong>Duration:</strong> See text</p>
        <p><strong>Saving Throw:</strong> See text</p>
        <p><strong>Spell Resistance:</strong> Yes</p>
        <p>You don't so much cast a miracle as request one. You state what you would like to have happen and request that your deity (or the power you pray to for spells) intercede.</p>
        <p>A miracle can do any of the following things.</p>
<ul>
<li>Duplicate any cleric spell of 8th level or lower (including spells to which you have access because of your domains).</li>
<li>Duplicate any other spell of 7th level or lower.</li>
<li>Undo the harmful effects of certain spells, such as feeblemind or insanity.</li>
<li>Have any effect whose power level is in line with the above effects.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the miracle has any of the above effects, casting it has no experience point cost.</p>
        <p>Alternatively, a cleric can make a very powerful request. Casting such a miracle costs the cleric 5,000 XP because of the powerful divine energies involved. Examples of especially powerful miracles of this sort could include the following.</p>
<ul>
<li>Swinging the tide of a battle in your favor by raising fallen allies to continue fighting.</li>
<li>Moving you and your allies, with all your and their gear, from one plane to another through planar barriers to a specific locale with no chance of error.</li>
<li>Protecting a city from an earthquake, volcanic eruption, flood, or other major natural disaster.</li>
</ul>
<p>In any event, a request that is out of line with the deity's (or alignment's) nature is refused.</p>
        <p>A duplicated spell allows saving throws and spell resistance as normal, but the save DCs are as for a 9th-level spell. When a miracle duplicates a spell that has an XP cost, you must pay that cost. When a miracle spell duplicates a spell with a material component that costs more than 100 gp, you must provide that component.</p>
        <p><strong>XP Cost:</strong> 5,000 XP (for some uses of the miracle spell; see above).</p>
