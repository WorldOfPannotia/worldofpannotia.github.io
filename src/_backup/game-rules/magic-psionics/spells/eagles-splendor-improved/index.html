        <p>The transmuted creature becomes more poised, articulate, and personally forceful. The spell grants a +10 enhancement bonus to Charisma, adding the usual benefits to Charisma-based skill checks and other uses of the Charisma modifier. Sorcerers and bards (and other spellcasters who rely on Charisma) affected by this spell do not gain any additional bonus spells for the increased Charisma, but the saveDCs for spells they cast while under this spell's effect do increase.</p>
        <p><em>Material Component:</em> A few feathers or a pinch of droppings from an eagle.</p>
