### [Wizards of the Coast](http://company.wizards.com/) {#wotc}

Obviously, if Dungeons &amp; Dragons did not exist, neither would this site. So I must pay respect to the company who continues to publish tons of new content for D&amp;D, [Wizards of the Coast](http://www.wizards.com/).

The following information is from the [About Us](http://ww2.wizards.com/Company/) section of the <strong>Wizards of the Coast</strong> web site (retrieved April 2013).

> The Wizards story is an epic tale of a tiny game company which started in Peter Adkison's basement in 1990 and grew to be a leader in the hobby gaming business and a part of the global Hasbro family. From those humble beginnings arose fantastic new worlds, stories, brands and entirely new types of play experiences that entertain communities of players through games, novels, comics, TV series, apparel and more.
>
> Our branded play experiences bring people together face-to-face or virtually to celebrate their shared passion and imagination. Our company is a unique environment full of creative people who are passionate about creating amazing play experiences, every day.
>
> Our story is for those who live to play.
