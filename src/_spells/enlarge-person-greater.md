  description:        |
    This spell causes the target humanoid creature to grow, quadrupling its height and multiplying its weight by 16. This increases the creature's size category by two steps. The target gains a +8 size bonus to Strength, a -4 size penalty to Dexterity (to a minimum of 1), and a -3 penalty on attack rolls and AC due to its increased size.

    If there is not enough room for the desired growth, the creature grows as much as possible and may make a Strength check (with its new modifier) to break free of the confining space. If it is unable to break out, the creature is considered immobile, but is not harmed.

    All equipment the creature is holding or carrying is enlarged in a similar fashion. Melee and projectile weapons affected by this spell deal more damage. Other magical properties a weapon or item may have are unaffected, however. Any enlarged item that leaves an enlarged creature's possession (including a projectile or thrown weapon) instantly returns to its normal size. This means that thrown weapons deal their normal damage, and projectiles deal damage based on the size of the weapon that fired them.

    Multiple magical effects that increase size do not stack.
