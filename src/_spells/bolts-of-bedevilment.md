  description:        |
    This spell grants the caster the ability to make one ray attack per round. The ray dazes one living creature, clouding its mind so that it takes no action for {% die_roll 1 3 0 %} rounds. The creature is not stunned (so attackers get no special advantage against it), but it can't move, cast spells, use mental abilities, and so on.
