    This spell functions like summon nature's ally I, except that you can summon one 7th-level creature, {% die_roll 1 3 0 %} 6th-level creatures of the same kind, or {% die_roll 1 4 1 %} lower-level creatures of the same kind.

    When you use a summoning spell to summon an air, chaotic, earth, evil, fire, good, lawful, or water creature, it is a spell of that type.
