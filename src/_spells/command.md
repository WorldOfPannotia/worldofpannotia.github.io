  description:        |
    You give the subject a single command, which it obeys to the best of its ability at its earliest opportunity. You may select from the following options.

    Approach: On its turn, the subject moves toward you as quickly and directly as possible for 1 round. The creature may do nothing but move during its turn, and it provokes attacks of opportunity for this movement as normal.

    Drop: On its turn, the subject drops whatever it is holding. It can't pick up any dropped item until its next turn.

    Fall: On its turn, the subject falls to the ground and remains prone for 1 round. It may act normally while prone but takes any appropriate penalties.

    Flee: On its turn, the subject moves away from you as quickly as possible for 1 round. It may do nothing but move during its turn, and it provokes attacks of opportunity for this movement as normal.

    Halt: The subject stands in place for 1 round. It may not take any actions but is not considered helpless.

    If the subject can't carry out your command on its next turn, the spell automatically fails.
