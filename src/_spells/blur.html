  description:        |
    The subject's outline appears blurred, shifting and wavering. This distortion grants the subject concealment (20% miss chance).

    A see invisibility spell does not counteract the blur effect, but a true seeing spell does.

    Opponents that cannot see the subject ignore the spell's effect (though fighting an unseen opponent carries penalties of its own).
