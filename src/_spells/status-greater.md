    As status, but you can also cast a limited selection of spells through the link, as if you were touching the target. You can cast any spell that meets the following conditions:

     * Level: 0, 1st, or 2nd
     * Range: Touch
     * Target: Creature touched
     * Saving Throw: harmless

    For example, if you become aware (through the greater status spell) that one of your linked companions is dying, you can cast cure moderate wounds to try to revive her.
