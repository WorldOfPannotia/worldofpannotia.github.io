    This spell has two versions.

    Prune Growth: This version causes normal vegetation within long range (400 feet + 40 feet per level) to shrink to about one-third of their normal size, becoming untangled and less bushy. The affected vegetation appears to have been carefully pruned and trimmed.

    At your option, the area can be a 100-foot-radius circle, a 150-foot-radius semicircle, or a 200-foot-radius quarter-circle.

    You may also designate portions of the area that are not affected.

    Stunt Growth: This version targets normal plants within a range of &#189; mile, reducing their potential productivity over the course of the following year to one third below normal.

    Diminish plants counters plant growth.

    This spell has no effect on plant creatures.
