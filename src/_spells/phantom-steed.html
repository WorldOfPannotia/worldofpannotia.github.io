  description:        |
    You conjure a Large, quasi-real, horselike creature. The steed can be ridden only by you or by the one person for whom you specifically created the mount. A phantom steed has a black head and body, gray mane and tail, and smoke-colored, insubstantial hooves that make no sound. It has what seems to be a saddle, bit, and bridle. It does not fight, but animals shun it and refuse to attack it.

    The mount has an AC of 18 (-1 size, +4 natural armor, +5 Dex) and 7 hit points +1 hit point per caster level. If it loses all its hit points, the phantom steed disappears. A phantom steed has a speed of 20 feet per caster level, to a maximum of 240 feet. It can bear its rider's weight plus up to 10 pounds per caster level.

    These mounts gain certain powers according to caster level. A mount's abilities include those of mounts of lower caster levels.

    8th Level: The mount can ride over sandy, muddy, or even swampy ground without difficulty or decrease in speed.

    10th Level: The mount can use water walk at will (as the spell, no action required to activate this ability).

    12th Level: The mount can use air walk at will (as the spell, no action required to activate this ability) for up to 1 round at a time, after which it falls to the ground.

    14th Level: The mount can fly at its speed (average maneuverability).
