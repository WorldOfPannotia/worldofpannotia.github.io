    Upon completion of this spell, the caster gestures toward the intended target, which must make a Fortitude save. If the save fails, the target suffers various effects according to the following table:

    |---
    | HD | Effect
    |-|-
    | Equal to caster level | Stunned for 1 round. This is an exception to the rule that constructs and animated objects are immune to stunning attacks.
    | Up to caster level -1 | Slowed for 1d4 rounds, stunned 1 round
    | Up to caster level -5 | Paralyzed for 2d4 rounds, slowed 1d4 rounds, stunned 1 round
    | Up to caster level -10 | "Killed" - The target is no longer considered a construct or animated object. It becomes a mundane item. (i.e. - Iron golem becomes a statue.)
