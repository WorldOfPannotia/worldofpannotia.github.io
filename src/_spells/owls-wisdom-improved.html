  description:        |
    The transmuted creature becomes wiser. The spell grants a +10 enhancement bonus to Wisdom, adding the usual benefit to Wisdom-related skills. Clerics, druids, paladins, and rangers (and other Wisdom-based spellcasters) who receive owl's wisdom do not gain any additional bonus spells for the increased Wisdom, but the saveDCs for their spells increase.
