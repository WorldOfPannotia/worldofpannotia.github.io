    Your _move silently_ check is opposed by the _listen_ check of anyone who might hear you. You can move up to one-half your normal speed at no penalty. When moving at a speed greater than one-half but less than your full speed, you take a -5 penalty. It's practically impossible (-20 penalty) to move silently while running or charging.
    Noisy surfaces, such as bogs or undergrowth, are tough to move silently across. When you try to sneak across such a surface, you take a penalty on your _move silently_ check as indicated below.
    |---
    | Surface | Check Modifier
    |-|-
    | Noisy (scree, shallow or deep bog, undergrowth, dense rubble) | -2
    | Very noisy (dense undergrowth, deep snow) | -5
