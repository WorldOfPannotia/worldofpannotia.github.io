  check: |
    An evening's time, a few gold pieces dropped into the donation box of the local bard's guild or temple, and a DC 10 _research_ check get you a general idea of a city's major news items, assuming there are no obvious reasons why the information would be withheld. The higher your check result, the better the information.

    If you want to find out about a specific rumor, or a specific item, or obtain a map, or do something else along those lines, the DC for the check is 15 to 25, or even higher.

    The primary difference between _gather information_ and _research_ is how the information is obtained. _gather information_ involves rubbing elbows with the locals at a bar or the market, whereas _research_ involves poring through scrolls and other documents in a temple, library, guild, or other such location.
  action: "A typical _research_ check takes 1d4+1 hours."
  try_again: "Yes, but it takes time for each check. Furthermore, you may draw attention to yourself if you repeatedly pursue a certain type of information."
  special: "If you have the Investigator feat, you get a +2 bonus on _research_ checks."
  synergy: |
     * If you have 5 or more ranks in _knowledge (local)_, you get a synergy bonus on _research_ checks.
