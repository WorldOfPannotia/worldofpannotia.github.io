    You generally must be within 10 feet of the object or surface to be searched. The table below gives DCs for typical tasks involving the _search_ skill.

    |---
    | Task | _search_ DC
    |-|-
    | Ransack a chest full of junk to find a certain item | 10
    | Notice a typical secret door or a simple trap | 20
    | Find a difficult nonmagical trap (rogue only)<sup>1</sup> | 21 or higher
    | Find a magic trap (rogue only)<sup>1</sup> | 25 + level of spell used to create trap
    | Notice a well-hidden secret door | 30
    | Find a footprint | Varies<sup>2</sup>

    | <sup>1</sup>Dwarves (even if they are not rogues) can use _search_ to find traps built into or out of stone.<br><sup>2</sup>A successful _search_ check can find a footprint or similar sign of a creature's passage, but it won't let you find or follow a trail. See the Track feat for the appropriate DC. |<

  special: |
    An elf has a +2 racial bonus on _search_ checks, and a half-elf has a +1 racial bonus. An elf (but not a half-elf) who simply passes within 5 feet of a secret or concealed door can make a _search_ check to find that door.

    If you have the Investigator feat, you get a +2 bonus on _search_ checks.

    The spells _explosive runes_, _fire trap_, _glyph of warding_, _symbol_, and _teleportation circle_ create magic traps that a rogue can find by making a successful _search_ check and then can attempt to disarm by using _disable device_. Identifying the location of a _snare_ spell has a DC of 23. _spike growth_ and _spike stones_ create magic traps that can be found using _search_, but against which _disable device_ checks do not succeed. See the individual spell descriptions for details.

    Active abjuration spells within 10 feet of each other for 24 hours or more create barely visible energy fluctuations. These fluctuations give you a +4 bonus on _search_ checks to locate such abjuration spells.
  synergy: |
     * If you have 5 or more ranks in _search_, you get a synergy bonus on _survival_ checks to find or follow tracks.
     * If you have 5 or more ranks in _knowledge (architecture and engineering)_, you get a synergy bonus on _search_ checks to find secret doors or hidden compartments.
  restriction: |
    While anyone can use _search_ to find a trap whose DC is 20 or lower, only a rogue can use _search_ to locate traps with higher DCs. (_Exception:_ The spell _find traps_ temporarily enables a cleric to use the _search_ skill as if he were a rogue.)

    A dwarf, even one who is not a rogue, can use the _search_ skill to find a difficult trap (one with a DC higher than 20) if the trap is built into or out of stone. He gains a +2 racial bonus on the _search_ check from his stonecunning ability.
