    _Ignore Caltrop Wound:_ If you are wounded by stepping on a caltrop, your speed is reduced to one-half normal. A successful _autohypnosis_ check removes this movement penalty. The wound doesn't go away &ndash; it is just ignored through self-persuasion.

    _Memorize:_ You can attempt to memorize a long string of numbers, a long passage of verse, or some other particularly difficult piece of information (but you can't memorize magical writing or similarly exotic scripts). Each successful check allows you to memorize a single page of text (up to 800 words), numbers, diagrams, or sigils (even if you don't recognize their meaning). If a document is longer than one page, you can make additional checks for each additional page. You always retain this information; however, you can recall it only with another successful _autohypnosis_ check.

    _Resist Dying:_ You can attempt to subconsciously prevent yourself from dying. If you have negative hit points and are losing hit points (at 1 per round, 1 per hour), you can substitute a DC 15 _autohypnosis_ check for your d% roll to see if you become stable. If the check is successful, you stop losing hit points (you do not gain any hit points, however, as a result of the check). You can substitute this check for the d% roll in later rounds if you are initially unsuccessful.

    _Resist Fear:_ In response to any fear effect, you make a saving throw normally. If you fail the saving throw, you can make an _autohypnosis_ check on your next round even while overcome by fear. If your _autohypnosis_ check meets or beats the DC for the fear effect, you shrug off the fear. On a failed check, the fear affects you normally, and you gain no further attempts to shrug off that particular fear effect.

    _Tolerate Poison:_ You can choose to substitute an _autohypnosis_ check for a saving throw against any standard poison's secondary damage or effect. This skill has no effect on the initial saving throw against poison.

    _Willpower:_ If reduced to 0 hit points (disabled), you can make an _autohypnosis_ check. If successful, you can take a normal action while at 0 hit points without taking 1 point of damage. You must make a check for each strenuous action you want to take. A failed _autohypnosis_ check in this circumstance carries no direct penalty &ndash; you can choose not to take the strenuous action and thus avoid the hit point loss. If you do so anyway, you drop to -1 hit points, as normal when disabled.
  action: "None. Making an _autohypnosis_ check doesn't require an action; it is either a free action (when attempted reactively) or part of another action (when attempted actively)."
  try_again: "Yes, for memorize and willpower uses, though a success doesn't cancel the effects of a previous failure. No for the other uses."
