    The _spot_ skill is used primarily to detect characters or creatures who are hiding. Typically, your _spot_ check is opposed by the _hide_ check of the creature trying not to be seen. Sometimes a creature isn't intentionally hiding but is still difficult to see, so a successful _spot_ check is necessary to notice it.

    A _spot_ check result higher than 20 generally lets you become aware of an invisible creature near you, though you can't actually see it.

    _spot_ is also used to detect someone in disguise (see the _disguise_ skill), and to read lips when you can't hear or understand what someone is saying.

    _spot_ checks may be called for to determine the distance at which an encounter begins. A penalty applies on such checks, depending on the distance between the two individuals or groups, and an additional penalty may apply if the character making the _spot_ check is distracted (not concentrating on being observant).

    | Condition | Penalty
    |-|-
    | Per 10 feet of distance | -1
    | Spotter distracted | -5

    _Read Lips:_To understand what someone is saying by reading lips, you must be within 30 feet of the speaker, be able to see him or her speak, and understand the speaker's language. (This use of the skill is language-dependent.) The base DC is 15, but it increases for complex speech or an inarticulate speaker. You must maintain a line of sight to the lips being read.

    If your _spot_ check succeeds, you can understand the general content of a minute's worth of speaking, but you usually still miss certain details. If the check fails by 4 or less, you can't read the speaker's lips. If the check fails by 5 or more, you draw some incorrect conclusion about the speech. The check is rolled secretly in this case, so that you don't know whether you succeeded or missed by 5.
  action: |
    Varies. Every time you have a chance to spot something in a reactive manner you can make a _spot_ check without using an action. Trying to spot something you failed to see previously is a move action. To read lips, you must concentrate for a full minute before making a _spot_ check, and you can't perform any other action (other than moving at up to half speed) during this minute.
  try_again: |
    Yes. You can try to spot something that you failed to see previously at no penalty. You can attempt to read lips once per minute.
