skill:
  description: "Like _craft_, _knowledge_, and _perform_, _profession_ is actually a number of separate skills. You could have several _profession_ skills, each with its own ranks, each purchased as a separate skill. While a _craft_ skill represents ability in creating or making an item, a _profession_ skill represents an aptitude in a vocation requiring a broader range of less specific knowledge."
  key_ability: "WIS"
  trained_only: true
  armor_check_penalty: false
  check: "You can practice your trade and make a decent living, earning about half your _profession_ check result in gold pieces per week of dedicated work. You know how to use the tools of your trade, how to perform the profession's daily tasks, how to supervise helpers, and how to handle common problems."
  action: "Not applicable. A single check generally represents a week of work."
  try_again: "Varies. An attempt to use a _profession_ skill to earn an income cannot be retried. You are stuck with whatever weekly wage your check result brought you. Another check may be made after a week to determine a new income for the next period of time. An attempt to accomplish some specific task can usually be retried."
  special: ""
  synergy: ""
  restriction: ""
  untrained: "Untrained laborers and assistants (that is, characters without any ranks in _profession_) earn an average of 1 silver piece per day."
