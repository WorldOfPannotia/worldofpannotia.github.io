    The table below gives the DCs to escape various forms of restraints.

    _Ropes:_ Your _escape artist_ check is opposed by the binder's _use rope_ check. Since it's easier to tie someone up than to escape from being tied up, the binder gets a +10 bonus on his or her check.

    _Manacles and Masterwork Manacles:_ The DC for manacles is set by their construction.

    _Tight Space:_ The DC noted on the table is for getting through a space where your head fits but your shoulders don't. If the space is long you may need to make multiple checks. You can't get through a space that your head does not fit through.

    _Grappler:_ You can make an _escape artist_ check opposed by your enemy's grapple check to get out of a grapple or out of a pinned condition (so that you're only grappling).

    |---
    | Restraint | _escape artist_ DC
    |-|-
    | Ropes | Binder's _use rope_ check +10
    | Net, _animate rope_ spell, _command plants_ spell, _control plants_ spell, or _entangle_ spell | 20
    | _snare_ spell | 23
    | Manacles | 30
    | Tight space | 30
    | Masterwork manacles | 35
    | Grappler | Grappler's grapple check result

  action: "Making an _escape artist_ check to escape from rope bindings, manacles, or other restraints (except a grappler) requires 1 minute of work. Escaping from a net or an _animate rope_, _command plants_, _control plants_, or _entangle_ spell is a full-round action. Escaping from a grapple or pin is a standard action. Squeezing through a tight space takes at least 1 minute, maybe longer, depending on how long the space is."
  try_again: "Varies. You can make another check after a failed check if you're squeezing your way through a tight space, making multiple checks. If the situation permits, you can make additional checks, or even take 20, as long as you're not being actively opposed."
  special: "If you have the Agile feat, you get a +2 bonus on _escape artist_ checks."
  synergy: |
     * If you have 5 or more ranks in _escape artist_ , you get a synergy bonus on _use rope_ checks to bind someone.
     * If you have 5 or more ranks in _use rope_, you get a synergy bonus on _escape artist_ checks when escaping from rope bonds.
