  description: |
    Like the _craft_ and _profession_ skills, _knowledge_ actually encompasses a number of unrelated skills. _knowledge_ represents a study of some body of lore, possibly an academic or even scientific discipline.

    Below are listed typical fields of study.

     * Arcana (ancient mysteries, magic traditions, arcane symbols, cryptic phrases, constructs, dragons, magical beasts)
     * Architecture and engineering (buildings, aqueducts, bridges, fortifications)
     * Dungeoneering (aberrations, caverns, oozes, spelunking)
     * Geography (lands, terrain, climate, people)
     * History (royalty, wars, colonies, migrations, founding of cities)
     * Local (legends, personalities, inhabitants, laws, customs, traditions, humanoids)
     * Nature (animals, fey, giants, monstrous humanoids, plants, seasons and cycles, weather, vermin)
     * Nobility and royalty (lineages, heraldry, family trees, mottoes, personalities)
     * Psionics (ancient mysteries, psionic traditions, psychic symbols, cryptic phrases, astral constructs, psionic races, psionic monsters)
     * Religion (gods and goddesses, mythic history, ecclesiastic tradition, holy symbols, undead)
     * The planes (the Inner Planes, the Outer Planes, the Astral Plane, the Ethereal Plane, outsiders, elementals, magic related to the planes)

  check: |
    Answering a question within your field of study has a DC of 10 (for really easy questions), 15 (for basic questions), or 20 to 30 (for really tough questions).

    In many cases, you can use this skill to identify monsters and their special powers or vulnerabilities. In general, the DC of such a check equals 10 + the monster's HD. A successful check allows you to remember a bit of useful information about that monster.

    For every 5 points by which your check result exceeds the DC, you recall another piece of useful information.
  action: "Usually none. In most cases, making a _knowledge_ check doesn't take an action &ndash; you simply know the answer or you don't."
  try_again: "No. The check represents what you know, and thinking about a topic a second time doesn't let you know something that you never learned in the first place."
