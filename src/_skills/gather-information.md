  check: |
    An evening's time, a few gold pieces for buying drinks and making friends, and a DC 10 _gather information_ check get you a general idea of a city's major news items, assuming there are no obvious reasons why the information would be withheld. The higher your check result, the better the information.

    If you want to find out about a specific rumor, or a specific item, or obtain a map, or do something else along those lines, the DC for the check is 15 to 25, or even higher.
  action: "A typical _gather information_ check takes 1d4+1 hours."
  try_again: "Yes, but it takes time for each check. Furthermore, you may draw attention to yourself if you repeatedly pursue a certain type of information."
  special: |
    A half-elf has a +2 racial bonus on _gather information_ checks.

    The _gather information_ skill has been split into two skills for different methods of investigation. Read about the new <a href="{{ site.url }}/game-rules/skills-feats/skills/#research">_research_ skill</a> below.
