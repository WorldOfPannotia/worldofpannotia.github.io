    A _bluff_ check is opposed by the target's _sense motive_ check. See the accompanying table for examples of different kinds of bluffs and the modifier to the target's _sense motive_ check for each one.

    Favorable and unfavorable circumstances weigh heavily on the outcome of a bluff. Two circumstances can weigh against you: The bluff is hard to believe, or the action that the target is asked to take goes against its self-interest, nature, personality, orders, or the like. If it's important, you can distinguish between a bluff that fails because the target doesn't believe it and one that fails because it just asks too much of the target. For instance, if the target gets a +10 bonus on its _sense motive_ check because the bluff demands something risky, and the _sense motive_ check succeeds by 10 or less, then the target didn't so much see through the bluff as prove reluctant to go along with it. A target that succeeds by 11 or more has seen through the bluff.

    A successful _bluff_ check indicates that the target reacts as you wish, at least for a short time (usually 1 round or less) or believes something that you want it to believe. _bluff_, however, is not a _suggestion_spell.

    A bluff requires interaction between you and the target. Creatures unaware of you cannot be bluffed.

    _Feinting in Combat:_ You can also use _bluff_ to mislead an opponent in melee combat (so that it can't dodge your next attack effectively). To feint, make a _bluff_ check opposed by your target's _sense motive_ check, but in this case, the target may add its base attack bonus to the roll along with any other applicable modifiers.

    If your _bluff_ check result exceeds this special _sense motive_ check result, your target is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC (if any) for the next melee attack you make against it. This attack must be made on or before your next turn.

    Feinting in this way against a non-humanoid is difficult because it's harder to read a strange creature's body language; you take a -4 penalty on your _bluff_ check. Against a creature of animal Intelligence (1 or 2) it's even harder; you take a -8 penalty. Against a non-intelligent creature, it's impossible.

    Feinting in combat does not provoke an attack of opportunity.

    _Creating a Diversion to Hide:_ You can use the _bluff_ skill to help you hide. A successful _bluff_ check gives you the momentary diversion you need to attempt a Hide check while people are aware of you. This usage does not provoke an attack of opportunity.

    _Delivering a Secret Message:_ You can use _bluff_ to get a message across to another character without others understanding it. The DC is 15 for simple messages, or 20 for complex messages, especially those that rely on getting across new information. Failure by 4 or less means you can't get the message across. Failure by 5 or more means that some false information has been implied or inferred. Anyone listening to the exchange can make a _sense motive_ check opposed by the _bluff_ check you made to transmit in order to intercept your message (see <a href="{{ site.url }}/game-rules/skills-feats/skills/#sense-motive">_sense motive_</a>).

    |-|-

  action: "Varies. A _bluff_ check made as part of general interaction always takes at least 1 round (and is at least a full-round action), but it can take much longer if you try something elaborate. A _bluff_ check made to feint in combat or create a diversion to hide is a standard action. A _bluff_ check made to deliver a secret message doesn't take an action; it is part of normal communication."
  try_again: |
    Varies. Generally, a failed _bluff_ check in social interaction makes the target too suspicious for you to try again in the same circumstances, but you may retry freely on _bluff_ checks made to feint in combat. Retries are also allowed when you are trying to send a message, but you may attempt such a retry only once per round.

    Each retry carries the same chance of miscommunication.
  special: |
    A ranger gains a bonus on _bluff_ checks when using this skill against a favored enemy.

    The master of a snake familiar gains a +3 bonus on _bluff_ checks.

    If you have the Persuasive feat, you get a +2 bonus on _bluff_ checks.
  synergy: |
     * If you have 5 or more ranks in _bluff_ , you get a synergy bonus on _diplomacy_, _intimidate_, and _sleight of hand_ checks, as well as on _disguise_ checks made when you know you're being observed and you try to act in character.
