    The _speak language_ skill doesn't work like other skills. Languages work as follows.

     * You start at 1st level knowing one or two languages (based on your race) at Rank 3 (see below), plus an additional number of languages at Rank 2 equal to your starting Intelligence bonus.
     * Characters with the _speak language_ skill in class may spend one skill point to gain two Ranks in a language, or one Rank each in two languages. Characters who do not have the skill in class must spend one skill point per Rank in any given language.
     * You don't make _speak language_ checks. You either know a language or you don't. Your level of understanding is based on how many ranks you have in a particular skill.

    When your character's Intelligence modifier increases at later levels, you gain an additional two ranks to spend in any of your racial bonus languages. If your bonus languages are all at Rank 3 already, you may use these ranks in other languages.

    | 0 | The character cannot speak or read the language at all.
    | 1 | The character has a basic understanding of the language. This is limited to simple verbal communication, but the character is able to maintain a conversation and be understood by others who speak it.
