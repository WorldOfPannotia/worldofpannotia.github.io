    Your _hide_ check is opposed by the _spot_ check of anyone who might see you. You can move up to one-half your normal speed and hide at no penalty. When moving at a speed greater than one-half but less than your normal speed, you take a -5 penalty. It's practically impossible (-20 penalty) to hide while attacking, running or charging.

    A creature larger or smaller than Medium takes a size bonus or penalty on _hide_ checks depending on its size category: Fine +16, Diminutive +12, Tiny +8, Small +4, Large -4, Huge -8, Gargantuan -12, Colossal -16.

    You need cover or concealment in order to attempt a _hide_ check. Total cover or total concealment usually (but not always; see Special, below) obviates the need for a _hide_ check, since nothing can see you anyway.

    If people are observing you, even casually, you can't hide. You can run around a corner or behind cover so that you're out of sight and then hide, but the others then know at least where you went.

    If your observers are momentarily distracted (such as by a _bluff_ check; see below), though, you can attempt to hide. While the others turn their attention from you, you can attempt a _hide_ check if you can get to a hiding place of some kind. (As a general guideline, the hiding place has to be within 1 foot per rank you have in _hide_.) This check, however, is made at a -10 penalty because you have to move fast.

    _Sniping:_ If you've already successfully hidden at least 10 feet from your target, you can make one ranged attack, then immediately hide again. You take a -20 penalty on your _hide_ check to conceal yourself after the shot.

    _Creating a Diversion to Hide:_ You can use _bluff_ to help you hide. A successful _bluff_ check can give you the momentary diversion you need to attempt a _hide_ check while people are aware of you.
  action: "Usually none. Normally, you make a _hide_ check as part of movement, so it doesn't take a separate action. However, hiding immediately after a ranged attack (see Sniping, above) is a move action."

    If you are invisible, you gain a +40 bonus on _hide_ checks if you are immobile, or a +20 bonus on _hide_ checks if you're moving.

    If you have the Stealthy feat, you get a +2 bonus on _hide_ checks.

    A 13th-level ranger can attempt a _hide_ check in any sort of natural terrain, even if it doesn't grant cover or concealment. A 17th-level ranger can do this even while being observed.
