    A DC 10 _sleight of hand_ check lets you palm a coin-sized, unattended object. Performing a minor feat of legerdemain, such as making a coin disappear, also has a DC of 10 unless an observer is determined to note where the item went.

    When you use this skill under close observation, your skill check is opposed by the observer's _spot_ check. The observer's success doesn't prevent you from performing the action, just from doing it unnoticed.

    You can hide a small object (including a light weapon or an easily concealed ranged weapon, such as a dart, sling, or hand crossbow) on your body. Your _sleight of hand_ check is opposed by the _spot_ check of anyone observing you or the _search_ check of anyone frisking you. In the latter case, the searcher gains a +4 bonus on the _search_ check, since it's generally easier to find such an object than to hide it. A dagger is easier to hide than most light weapons, and grants you a +2 bonus on your _sleight of hand_ check to conceal it. An extraordinarily small object, such as a coin, shuriken, or ring, grants you a +4 bonus on your _sleight of hand_ check to conceal it, and heavy or baggy clothing (such as a cloak) grants you a +2 bonus on the check.

    Drawing a hidden weapon is a standard action and doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity.

    If you try to take something from another creature, you must make a DC 20 _sleight of hand_ check to obtain it. The opponent makes a _spot_ check to detect the attempt, opposed by the same _sleight of hand_ check result you achieved when you tried to grab the item. An opponent who succeeds on this check notices the attempt, regardless of whether you got the item.

    You can also use _sleight of hand_ to entertain an audience as though you were using the _perform_ skill. In such a case, your "act" encompasses elements of legerdemain, juggling, and the like.

  action: |
    Any _sleight of hand_ check normally is a standard action. However, you may perform a _sleight of hand_ check as a free action by taking a -20 penalty on the check.
  try_again: |
    Yes, but after an initial failure, a second _sleight of hand_ attempt against the same target (or while you are being watched by the same observer who noticed your previous attempt) increases the DC for the task by 10.
  special: |
    If you have the Deft Hands feat, you get a +2 bonus on _sleight of hand_ checks.
  synergy: |
     * If you have 5 or more ranks in _bluff_, you get a synergy bonus on _sleight of hand_ checks.
  restriction: ""
  untrained: |
    An untrained _sleight of hand_ check is simply a Dexterity check. Without actual training, you can't succeed on any _sleight of hand_ check with a DC higher than 10, except for hiding an object on your body.
