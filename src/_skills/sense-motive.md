    A successful check lets you avoid being bluffed (see the _bluff_ skill). You can also use this skill to determine when "something is up" (that is, something odd is going on) or to assess someone's trustworthiness.

    | Hunch | 20

    | Discern secret message | Varies

    _Hunch:_ This use of the skill involves making a gut assessment of the social situation. You can get the feeling from another's behavior that something is wrong, such as when you're talking to an impostor. Alternatively, you can get the feeling that someone is trustworthy.

    _Sense Enchantment:_ You can tell that someone's behavior is being influenced by an enchantment effect (by definition, a mind-affecting effect), even if that person isn't aware of it. The usual DC is 25, but if the target is dominated (see _dominate person_), the DC is only 15 because of the limited range of the target's activities.

    _Discern Secret Message:_You may use _sense motive_ to detect that a hidden message is being transmitted via the _bluff_ skill. In this case, your _sense motive_ check is opposed by the _bluff_ check of the character transmitting the message. For each piece of information relating to the message that you are missing, you take a -2 penalty on your _sense motive_ check. If you succeed by 4 or less, you know that something hidden is being communicated, but you can't learn anything specific about its content. If you beat the DC by 5 or more, you intercept and understand the message. If you fail by 4 or less, you don't detect any hidden communication. If you fail by 5 or more, you infer some false information.
  action: |
    Trying to gain information with _sense motive_ generally takes at least 1 minute, and you could spend a whole evening trying to get a sense of the people around you.
  try_again: |
    No, though you may make a _sense motive_ check for each _bluff_ check made against you.
  special: |
    A ranger gains a bonus on _sense motive_ checks when using this skill against a favored enemy.

    If you have the Negotiator feat, you get a +2 bonus on _sense motive_ checks.
  synergy: |
     * If you have 5 or more ranks in _sense motive_ , you get a synergy bonus on _diplomacy_ checks.
