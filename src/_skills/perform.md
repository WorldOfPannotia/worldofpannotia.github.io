title: "Perform"

skill:
  description: |
    Like _craft_, _knowledge_, and _profession_, _perform_ is actually a number of separate skills.

    You could have several _perform_ skills, each with its own ranks, each purchased as a separate skill.

    Each of the nine categories of the _perform_ skill includes a variety of methods, instruments, or techniques, a small list of which is provided for each category below.

     * Act (comedy, drama, mime)
     * Comedy (buffoonery, limericks, joke-telling)
     * Dance (ballet, waltz, jig)
     * Keyboard instruments (harpsichord, piano, pipe organ)
     * Oratory (epic, ode, storytelling)
     * Percussion instruments (bells, chimes, drums, gong)
     * String instruments (fiddle, harp, lute, mandolin)
     * Wind instruments (flute, pan pipes, recorder, shawm, trumpet)
     * Sing (ballad, chant, melody)

    | 15 | Enjoyable performance. In a prosperous city, you can earn 1d10 sp/day.
    | 20 | Great performance. In a prosperous city, you can earn 3d10 sp/day. In time, you may be invited to join a professional troupe and may develop a regional reputation.
    | 25 | Memorable performance. In a prosperous city, you can earn 1d6 gp/day. In time, you may come to the attention of noble patrons and develop a national reputation.
    | 30 | Extraordinary performance. In a prosperous city, you can earn 3d6 gp/day. In time, you may draw attention from distant potential patrons, or even from extraplanar beings.

    A masterwork musical instrument gives you a +2 circumstance bonus on _perform_ checks that involve its use.
  action: "Varies. Trying to earn money by playing in public requires anywhere from an evening's work to a full day's performance. The bard's special _perform_ -based abilities are described in that class's description."
  try_again: "Yes. Retries are allowed, but they don't negate previous failures, and an audience that has been unimpressed in the past is likely to be prejudiced against future performances. (Increase the DC by 2 for each previous failure.)"
  special: |
    A bard must have at least 3 ranks in a _perform_ skill to inspire courage in his allies, or to use his countersong or his _fascinate_ ability. A bard needs 6 ranks in a _perform_ skill to inspire competence, 9 ranks to use his _suggestion_ ability, 12 ranks to inspire greatness, 15 ranks to use his _song of freedom_ ability, 18 ranks to inspire heroics, and 21 ranks to use his _mass suggestion_ ability. See Bardic Music in the bard class description.

    In addition to using the _perform_ skill, you can entertain people with sleight of hand, tumbling, tightrope walking, and spells (especially illusions).
