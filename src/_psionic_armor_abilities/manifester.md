  description: |
    This kind of shield generates 3 power points once per day that the wearer can use when manifesting a power he knows. These power points must all be used on the same power. As usual, a psionic character cannot pay a power's cost with power points from more than one source, so the power points in the shield must be used for discrete manifestations.
