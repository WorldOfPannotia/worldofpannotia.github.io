title: Aboleth
---


The aboleth is a revolting fishlike amphibian found primarily in subterranean lakes and rivers. An aboleth has a pink belly. Four pulsating blueblack orifices line the bottom of its body and secrete gray slime that smells like rancid grease. It uses its tail for propulsion in the water and drags itself along with its tentacles on land. An aboleth weighs about 6,500 pounds.

<h4>Spells, Psionics, Special Qualities, &amp; Special Abilities</h4>

**Enslave (Su):** Three times per day, an aboleth can attempt to enslave any one living creature within 30 feet. The target must succeed on a DC 18 Will save or be affected as though by a {% spell_link dominate-person %} spell (caster level 16th). An enslaved creature obeys the aboleth's telepathic commands until freed by {% spell_link remove-curse %}, and can attempt a new Will save every 24 hours to break free. The control is also broken if the aboleth dies or travels more than 1 mile from its slave. The save DC is Charisma-based.

**Psionics (Sp) (CL 16):** At will &ndash; {% spell_link hypnotic-pattern %} (DC 16), {% spell_link illusory-wall %} (DC 18), {% spell_link mirage-arcana %} (DC 19), {% spell_link persistent-image %} (DC 19), {% spell_link programmed-image %} (DC 20), {% spell_link project-image %} (DC 21), {% spell_link veil %} (DC 20). The save DCs are Charisma-based.

**Slime (Ex):** A blow from an aboleth's tentacle can cause a terrible affliction. A creature hit by a tentacle must succeed on a DC 20 Fortitude save or begin to transform over the next {% die_roll 1 4 1 %} minutes, the skin gradually becoming a clear, slimy membrane. An afflicted creature must remain moistened with cool, fresh water or take {% die_roll 1 12 0 %} points of damage every 10 minutes. The slime reduces the creature's natural armor bonus by 1 (but never to less than 0). The save DC is Constitution-based.

A {% spell_link remove-disease %} spell cast before the transformation is complete will restore an afflicted creature to normal. Afterward, however, only a {% spell_link heal %} or {% spell_link heal-mass "mass heal" %} spell can reverse the affliction.

**Mucus Cloud (Ex):** An aboleth underwater surrounds itself with a viscous cloud of mucus roughly 1 foot thick. Any creature coming into contact with and inhaling this substance must succeed on a DC 20 Fortitude save or lose the ability to breathe air for the next 3 hours. An affected creature suffocates in {% die_roll 2 6 0 %} minutes if removed from the water. Renewed contact with the mucus cloud and failing another Fortitude save continues the effect for another 3 hours. The save DC is Constitution-based.

**Skills:** An aboleth has a +8 racial bonus on any {% skill_link swim %} check to perform some special action or avoid a hazard. It can always choose to take 10 on a {% skill_link swim %} check, even if distracted or endangered. It can use the run action while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line.
