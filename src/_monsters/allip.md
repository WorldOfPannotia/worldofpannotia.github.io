title: Allip

An allip is the spectral remains of someone driven to suicide by a madness that afflicted it in life. It craves only revenge and unrelentingly pursues those who tormented it in life and pushed it over the brink.

An allip cannot speak intelligibly.

<h4>Spells, Psionics, Special Qualities, &amp; Special Abilities</h4>

**Babble (Su):** An allip constantly mutters and whines to itself, creating a hypnotic effect. All sane creatures within 60 feet of the allip must succeed on a DC 16 Will save or be affected as though by a hypnotism spell for {% die_roll 2 4 0 %} rounds. This is a sonic mind-affecting compulsion effect.

Creatures that successfully save cannot be affected by the same allip's babble for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.

**Madness (Su):** Anyone targeting an allip with a thought detection, mind control, or telepathic ability makes direct contact with its tortured mind and takes {% die_roll 1 4 0 %} points of Wisdom damage.

**Wisdom Drain (Su):** An allip causes {% die_roll 1 4 0 %} points of Wisdom drain each time it hits with its incorporeal touch attack. On each such successful attack, it gains 5 temporary hit points.
