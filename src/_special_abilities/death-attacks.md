title: "Death Attacks"

ability:
  description: |
    In most cases, a death attack allows the victim a Fortitude save to avoid the affect, but if the save fails, the character dies instantly.

     * {% spell_link raise-dead %} doesn't work on someone killed by a death attack.
     * Death attacks slay instantly. A victim cannot be made stable and thereby kept alive.
     * In case it matters, a dead character, no matter how she died, has -10 hit points.
     * The spell {% spell_link death-ward %} protects a character against these attacks.
