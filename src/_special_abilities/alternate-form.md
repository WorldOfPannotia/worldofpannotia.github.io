title: "Alternate Form"

ability:
  types: ["Su"]
  description: |
    A creature with this special quality has the ability to assume one or more specific alternate forms. This ability works much like the {% spell_link polymorph %} spell, except that the creature is limited to the forms specified, and does not regain any hit points for changing its form. Assuming an alternate form results in the following changes to the creature:

     * The creature retains the type and subtype of its original form. It gains the size of its new form.
     * The creature loses the natural weapons, natural armor, movement modes, and extraordinary special attacks of its original form.
     * The creature gains the natural weapons, natural armor, movement modes, and extraordinary special attacks of its new form.
     * The creature retains the special qualities of its original form. It does not gain any special qualities of its new form.
     * The creature retains the spell-like abilities and supernatural attacks of its old form (except for breath weapons and gaze attacks). It does not gain the spell-like abilities or supernatural attacks of its new form.
     * The creature gains the physical ability scores (Str, Dex, Con) of its new form. It retains the mental ability scores (Int, Wis, Cha) of its original form.
     * The creature retains its hit points and save bonuses, although its save modifiers may change due to a change in ability scores.
     * The creature retains any spellcasting ability it had in its original form, although it must be able to speak intelligibly to cast spells with verbal components and it must have humanlike hands to cast spells with somatic components.
     * The creature is effectively camouflaged as a creature of its new form, and it gains a +10 bonus on {% skill_link disguise %} checks if it uses this ability to create a disguise.
