title: "Summon"

ability:
  types: ["Sp"]
  description: |
    A creature with the _summon_ ability can summon specific other creatures of its kind much as though casting a _summon monster_ spell, but it usually has only a limited chance of success (as specified in the creature's entry). Roll d%: On a failure, no creature answers the summons. Summoned creatures automatically return whence they came after 1 hour. A creature that has just been summoned cannot use its own summon ability for 1 hour. Most creatures with the ability to summon do not use it lightly, since it leaves them beholden to the summoned creature. In general, they use it only when necessary to save their own lives. An appropriate spell level is given for each summoning ability for purposes of _concentration_ checks and attempts to dispel the summoned creature. No experience points are awarded for summoned monsters.
