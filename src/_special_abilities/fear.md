title: "Fear"

ability:
  types: ["Su", "Sp"]
  description: |
    Spells, magic items, and certain monsters can affect characters with fear. Fear attacks can have various effects. In most cases, the character makes a Will saving throw to resist this effect, and a failed roll means that the character is shaken, frightened, or panicked.

    _Fear Aura (Su):_ The use of this ability is a free action. The aura can freeze an opponent (such as a mummy's despair) or function like the {% spell_link fear %} spell. Other effects are possible. A fear aura is an area effect. The descriptive text gives the size and kind of area.

    _Fear Cones (Sp) and Rays (Su):_ These effects usually work like the {% spell_link fear %} spell.

    If a fear effect allows a saving throw, it is a Will save (DC 10 + &#189; fearsome creature's racial HD + creature's Cha modifier; the exact DC is given in the creature's descriptive text). All fear attacks are mind-affecting fear effects.

    **Becoming Even More Fearful:** Fear effects are cumulative. A shaken character who is made shaken again becomes frightened, and a shaken character who is made frightened becomes panicked instead. A frightened character who is made shaken or frightened becomes panicked instead.
