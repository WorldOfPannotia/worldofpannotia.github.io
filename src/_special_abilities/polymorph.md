title: "Polymorph"

ability:
  description: |
    Magic can cause creatures and characters to change their shapes &ndash; sometimes against their will, but usually to gain an advantage. Polymorphed creatures retain their own minds but have new physical forms.

    The {% spell_link polymorph %} spell defines the general polymorph effect.

    Since creatures do not change types, a slaying or bane weapon designed to kill or harm creatures of a specific type affects those creatures even if they are polymorphed. Likewise, a creature polymorphed into the form of a creature of a different type is not subject to slaying and bane effects directed at that type of creature.

    A ranger's favored enemy bonus is based on knowing what the foe is, so if a creature that is a ranger's favored enemy polymorphs into another form, the ranger is denied his bonus.

    A dwarf's bonus for fighting giants is based on shape and size, so he does not gain a bonus against a giant polymorphed into something else, but does gain the bonus against any creature polymorphed into a giant.
