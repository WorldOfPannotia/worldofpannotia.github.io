          The epic loremaster's caster level increases by 1 per level gained above 10th. The epic loremaster continues to gain new spells per day (and spells known, if applicable) at each new level, up to the maximum spells per day and spells known of the spellcasting class to which the loremaster belonged before adding the prestige class.

          The loremaster doesn't gain additional secrets after 10th level, because there is a limit to the number of secrets that can be gained, but the character can choose a lore-master secret instead of a bonus feat. Remember that a character can't select the same secret twice.
