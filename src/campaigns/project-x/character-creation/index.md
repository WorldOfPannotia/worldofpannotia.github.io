[Printable spreadsheet version of the character sheet]({{ site.url }}/downloads/character-sheets/_character-sheet-template.xls)

#### Ability Scores

When generating ability scores, you can use the standard &quot;4d6 drop the lowest&quot; method **OR** you can use a 32-point buy method. If you choose to roll ability scores, please wait to roll them until the night of character creation.

Note that the bonuses to [ability scores over time]({{ site.url }}/game-rules/basics/#abilities-over-time) are different than standard 3.5 edition.

If you want something to help calculate abilities, skill points, etc, feel free to use [this spreadsheet]({{ site.url }}/downloads/Abilities.xls) (ODS). It is the same one I plan to use for NPCs, enemies, and the like.

#### Races

The following races are allowed for this campaign:

 * [Dwarves]({{ site.url }}/game-rules/races-classes/races/dwarf/)
 * [Elflings]({{ site.url }}/game-rules/races-classes/races/elfling/)
 * [Elves]({{ site.url }}/game-rules/races-classes/races/elf/)
 * [Faldirin]({{ site.url }}/game-rules/races-classes/races/faldirin/)
 * [Gnomes]({{ site.url }}/game-rules/races-classes/races/gnome/)
 * [Halflings]({{ site.url }}/game-rules/races-classes/races/halfling/)
 * [Half-Elves]({{ site.url }}/game-rules/races-classes/races/half-elf/)
 * [Half-Giants]({{ site.url }}/game-rules/races-classes/races/half-giant/) (ignore the bonus psionic points; the psi-like ability is allowed)
 * [Half-Orcs]({{ site.url }}/game-rules/races-classes/races/half-orc/)
 * [Humans]({{ site.url }}/game-rules/races-classes/races/human/)
 * [Thaellegoth]({{ site.url }}/game-rules/races-classes/races/thaellegoth/)

The following races are allowed for this campaign if you ask nicely and write a good background story for your character:

 * [Bugbear]({{ site.url }}/game-rules/races-classes/races/bugbear/)
 * [Centaur]({{ site.url }}/game-rules/races-classes/races/centaur/)
 * [Dark Elves]({{ site.url }}/game-rules/races-classes/races/dark-elf/)
 * [Duergar]({{ site.url }}/game-rules/races-classes/races/duergar/)
 * [Hobgoblin]({{ site.url }}/game-rules/races-classes/races/hobgoblin/)
 * [Lizardfolk]({{ site.url }}/game-rules/races-classes/races/lizardfolk/)
 * [Satyr]({{ site.url }}/game-rules/races-classes/races/satyr/) (no pipes)

Psionic races are explicitly disallowed (unless noted above).

A few of the races ([Faldirin]({{ site.url }}/game-rules/races-classes/races/faldirin/), [Elflings]({{ site.url }}/game-rules/races-classes/races/elfling/), and [Thaellegoth]({{ site.url }}/game-rules/races-classes/races/thaellegoth/)) have not been extensively playtested, though I believe they are balanced against the rest. If you choose one of these, be aware that there is a small chance of needing to make changes to the race during the campaign to address unforeseen balance issues.

If you want to play one of the non-core races or a race described elsewhere, please send me an email in advance detailing the race (if it is not on this site) and your reasoning.

When the party reaches epic levels, if you are interested in an [epic prestige class]({{ site.url }}/game-rules/races-classes/epic/), let me know. We will work those out on a case-by-case basis.

If you want to play a class described elsewhere, please send me an email in advance detailing the class and your reasoning.

#### Starting Level and Experience

The campaign will start at level 16. Because of the nature and duration of the campaign, I will be foregoing the standard experience process in favor of a &quot;level / no level&quot; announcement at the end of each session. (This will not be primarily dependent upon whether the party follows the plot or not, but rather on how well the party roleplays in general.)

It is safe to say that you can expect to play an epic character during this campaign.

#### Starting Equipment

You will have 260,000gp to buy all of your starting equipment. No single item may cost more than half of your total.

Any non-psionic [items or equipment]({{ site.url }}/equipment/) on this site are generally acceptable. Also acceptable are items from the D&amp;D 3.5 Player's Handbook, Dungeon Master's Guide, and Magic Item Compendium.

If you want to buy equipment or magic items not listed here or in one of the three books mentioned above, please send me an email in advance with details about the item(s) you want and your reasoning.

Please show me your starting equipment lists before the campaign. Although I have said that items in the PHB, DMG, and MIC are acceptable, some items may be more rare, cost more, etc.

#### Phyical Description

At a minimum, I would like to have a basic (but complete) physical description of each character. This should include physical appearence as well as general attitude and mannerisms. Feel free to add as much detail as you want.

#### Back Story

At a minimum, I would like for everyone to answer [these basic questions]({{ site.url }}/campaigns/resources/basic-character-questions/) about their character. Most of the questions can be answered with a simple "yes" or "no". Feel free to elaborate as much as you want.

**Note:** You do not need to answer #16 on the basic questionnaire. It is assumed that all of your characters are members of the same organization. Once the actual affiliation is defined, feel free to describe how your character became a member of the organization / guild.

For those who are particularly interested in creating a detailed back story, you can either write a more complete story or fill out as much of the [advanced questionnaire]({{ site.url }}/campaigns/resources/advanced-character-questions/) as you'd like.

**Detailed back stories will be rewarded with direct in-game benefits.** Aside from the fact that I can (ab)use your back stories to create interesting situations during the campaign, I have every intention of stealing ideas to incorporate into the global history of Pannotia.
