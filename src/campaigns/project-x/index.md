### Campaign Overview

My plan for Project X is to have a campaign in which the PCs may end up shaping the course of history in Pannotia. I have a number of plots in mind for the campaign, and the path the party chooses will have a direct impact on the chain of events.

I am keeping things somewhat close to the vest for the present, but more details about the campaign will be revealed over time.

#### Alignment and Party Cohesion

I don't have a huge preference for the group's alignment, other than "no evil characters". I do, however, want the group to have some kind of common link prior to the beginning of the story. I haven't figured out what it will be yet, but it will likely be some kind of organization or guild.

My goal is to eliminate the need for the typical "You seem like a trustworthy fellow. Join our group of adventurers!" scenario. Since the party is starting at a fairly high level (see "Character Creation" below), it doesn't seem like that would fit in this campaign.
