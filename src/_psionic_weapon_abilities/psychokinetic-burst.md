  description: |
    This weapon functions as a psychokinetic weapon that also releases a blast of destructive psionic energy upon scoring a successful critical hit. In addition to the extra damage of the psychokinetic ability (see above), a psychokinetic burst weapon deals an extra {% die_roll 1 6 0 %} points of damage on a successful critical hit. If the weapon's critical multiplier is &times;3, add {% die_roll 2 6 0 %} points of extra damage instead, and if the multiplier is &times;4, add {% die_roll 3 6 0 %} points of extra damage. This extra damage is ectoplasmic in nature and is not affected by damage reduction. Bows, crossbows, and slings bestow this ability upon their ammunition.
