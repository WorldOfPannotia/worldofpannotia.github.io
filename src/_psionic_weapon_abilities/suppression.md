  description: |
    An opponent or object struck by this kind of weapon is subject to a targeted {% power_link dispel-psionics %} power. The wielder makes a power check ({% die_roll 1 20 0 %} + 5 + manifester level, maximum +15) against a DC of 11 + the manifester level of the power to be dispelled. Bows, crossbows, and slings bestow this ability upon their ammunition, but can do so only three times per day.
