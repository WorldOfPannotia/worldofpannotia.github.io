  description: |
    This ability can be embedded only in weapons that can be thrown. A teleporting weapon returns through the Astral Plane to the creature that threw it. It teleports into the throwing creature's empty hand in the round following the round when it was thrown, just before that creature's turn. It is therefore ready to use again on that turn.
