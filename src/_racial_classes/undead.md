       * Not at risk of death from massive damage, but when reduced to 0 hit points or less, it is immediately destroyed.
       * Not affected by raise dead and reincarnate spells or abilities. Resurrection and true resurrection can affect undead creatures. These spells turn undead creatures back into the living creatures they were before becoming undead.
       * Proficient with its natural weapons, all simple weapons, and any weapons mentioned in its entry.
       * Proficient with whatever type of armor (light, medium, or heavy) it is described as wearing, as well as all lighter types. Undead not indicated as wearing armor are not proficient with armor. Undead are proficient with shields if they are proficient with any form of armor.
       * Undead do not breathe, eat, or sleep.
