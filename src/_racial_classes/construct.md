    traits: |
       * No Constitution score.
       * Low-light vision.
       * Darkvision out to 60 feet.
       * Immunity to all mind-affecting effects (charms, compulsions, phantasms, patterns, and morale effects).
       * Immunity to poison, sleep effects, paralysis, stunning, disease, death effects, and necromancy effects.
       * Cannot heal damage on their own, but often can be repaired by exposing them to a certain kind of effect (see the creature's description for details) or through the use of the Craft Construct feat. A construct with the <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/specialAbilities.htm#fastHealing">fast healing</a> special quality still benefits from that quality.
       * Not subject to critical hits, nonlethal damage, ability damage, ability drain, fatigue, exhaustion, or energy drain.
       * Immunity to any effect that requires a Fortitude save (unless the effect also works on objects, or is harmless).
       * Not at risk of death from massive damage. Immediately destroyed when reduced to 0 hit points or less.
       * Since it was never alive, a construct cannot be raised or resurrected.
       * Because its body is a mass of unliving matter, a construct is hard to destroy. It gains bonus hit points based on size, as shown on the table.
       * Proficient with its natural weapons only, unless generally humanoid in form, in which case proficient with any weapon mentioned in its entry.
       * Proficient with no armor.
       * Constructs do not eat, sleep, or breathe.
