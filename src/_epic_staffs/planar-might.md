  description: |
    The wielder of this powerful staff is immune to the effects of any planar alignment traits, as well as the positive-dominant and negative-dominant traits or a plane. It also allows use of the following spells.

     * {% spell_link planar-ally-greater %} (1 charge)
     * {% spell_link planar-binding-greater %} (1 charge)
     * {% spell_link gate %} (1 charge)

    When using the {% spell_link planar-ally-greater %} power, the character must still bargain with the called creature.

    In addition to its other powers, a _staff of planar might_ is a +_5 outsider bane quarterstaff_ (roll 1d4 to determine what alignment of outsiders the staff's bane power works against: 1=chaotic, 2=evil, 3=good, 4=lawful). After all charges are used up from a _staff of planar might,_ it remains a +_5 quarterstaff_ with no special abilities.
