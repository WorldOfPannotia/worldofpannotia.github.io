This +_5 flaming quarterstaff_ grants its wielder fire resistance 30 whenever held. In addition, it has the following powers.
     * {% spell_link wall-of-fire %} (extended, 1 charge, DC 18)
     * {% spell_link delayed-blast-fireball %} (intensified to 240 points of damage, 2 charges, DC 22)
     * {% spell_link meteor-swarm %} (heightened to 12th, 2 charges, DC 30)
     * {% spell_link summon-monster-ix %} (extended, 2 charges, elder fire elemental only) A _staff of fiery power_ can be broken in a retributive strike. The breaking of the staff must be purposeful and declared by the wielder. All charges currently in the staff are instantly released in a 30-foot- radius globe. All within 10 feet of the broken staff take points of damage equal to eight times the number of charges in the staff, those between 11 feet and 20 feet away take six times the number of charges in damage, and those 21 feet to 30 feet distant take four times the number of charges in damage. Successful Reflex saving throws (DC 17) reduce the damage sustained by half. The character breaking the staff has a 50% chance of traveling to another plane of existence; if he or she does not, the explosive release of spell energy destroys him or her. After all charges are used up from the staff, it remains a +_5 quarterstaff_ with no special abilities. (Once empty of charges, it cannot be broken in a retributive strike.)
