  description: |
    You generally know where you are. This power is useful to characters who end up at unfamiliar destinations after teleporting, using a gate, or traveling to or from other planes of existence. The power reveals general information about your location as a feeling or presentiment. The information is usually no more detailed than a summary that locates you according to a prominent local or regional site. Using this power also tells you what direction you are facing.

    Using this power prior to making a Knowledge (the planes) check with astral caravan grants a +2 bonus on the check.
