  description: |
    You can improve your chances in a grapple as an immediate action, gaining a +4 enhancement bonus on your grapple checks.

    You can manifest this power with an instant thought, quickly enough to gain the benefit of the power in the current round. Manifesting this power is an immediate action. You can manifest this power when it isn't your turn (if you are grappled).
  augment: |
    For every 4 additional power points you spend, the enhancement bonus on your grapple checks increases by 2.
