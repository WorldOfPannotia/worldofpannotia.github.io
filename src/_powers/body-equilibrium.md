  description: |
    You can adjust your body's equilibrium to correspond with any solid or liquid that you stand on. Thus, you can walk on water, quicksand, or even a spider's web without sinking or breaking through (this effect does not confer any resistance to particularly sticky webs). You can move at your normal speed, but you cannot run (&times;4 speed) on an unfirm surface without sinking or breaking through.

    If you fall from any height while using this power, damage from the impact is halved.
