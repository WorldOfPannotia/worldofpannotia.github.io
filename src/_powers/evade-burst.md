  description: |
    You throw off a faux ectoplasmic shell, allowing you to slide out of range of a damaging effect. When you manifest this power in conjunction with making a successful Reflex save against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, you instead take no damage.

    You can manifest this power with an instant thought, quickly enough to save yourself if you unexpectedly come within range of a dangerous effect. Manifesting this power is an immediate action. You can even manifest this power when it isn't your turn.
  augment: |
    If you spend 4 additional power points, you take only half damage on a failed Reflex save.
