  description: |
    You link your mind with another psionic creature's mind, creating a brief conduit through which mental energy can be shared. When you manifest this power, the subject gains up to 2 power points. You can transfer only as many power points to a subject as it has manifester levels.

    Because of the intimate nature of this power, it cannot be fabricated into a psionic item-only power points generated by a psionic creature in the moment can be shared using bestow power.
  augment: |
    For every 3 additional power points you spend, the subject gains 2 additional power points.
