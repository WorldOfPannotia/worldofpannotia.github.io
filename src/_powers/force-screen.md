  description: |
    You create an invisible mobile disk of force that hovers in front of you. The force screen provides a +4 shield bonus to Armor Class (which applies against incorporeal touch attacks, since the force screen is a force effect). Since it hovers in front of you, the effect has no armor check penalty associated with it.
  augment: |
    For every 4 additional power points you spend, the shield bonus to Armor Class improves by 1.
