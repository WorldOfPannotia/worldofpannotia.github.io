  description: |
    You create a psychokinetic shield around the subject that improves the chance that any powers affecting the subject will resist a dispel psionics power (or a dispel magic spell) or a negation effect that targets a specific power (such as shatter mind blank). When dispelling buffer is manifested on a creature or object, add +5 to the DC of the dispel check for each ongoing effect that is subject to being dispelled.

    Dispel psionics can negate dispelling buffer, but against a targeted dispel, dispelling buffer is always checked last (with the same +5 bonus). Against an area dispel, dispelling buffer is checked in the order according to its level (with the same +5 bonus).

    Special: When a Psychic Warrior manifests this power, the range is personal and the target is the manifester.
