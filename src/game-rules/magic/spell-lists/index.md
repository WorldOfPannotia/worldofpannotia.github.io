**Order of Presentation:** In the spell lists and the spell descriptions that follow them, the spells are presented in alphabetical order by name except for those belonging to certain spell chains.

When a spell's name begins with "lesser," "greater," or "mass," the spell description is alphabetized under the second word of the spell name instead.

**Hit Dice:** The term "Hit Dice" is used synonymously with "character levels" for effects that affect a number of Hit Dice of creatures. Creatures with Hit Dice only from their race, not from classes, have character levels equal to their Hit Dice.

**Caster Level:** A spell's power often depends on caster level, which is defined as the caster's class level for the purpose of casting a particular spell. A creature with no classes has a caster level equal to its Hit Dice unless otherwise specified. The word "level" in the spell lists that follow always refers to caster level.

**Creatures and Characters:** The words "creature" and "character" are used synonymously in the spell descriptions.
