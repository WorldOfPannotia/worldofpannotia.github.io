[Jump to prestige class list.](#class-list)

Prestige classes offer a new form of multiclassing. Unlike the basic classes, characters must meet a pre-set list of requirements before they can take their first level of a prestige class. The rules for level advancement apply to this system, meaning the first step of advancement is always choosing a class. If a character does not meet the requirements for a prestige class before that first step, that character cannot take the first level of that prestige class.  Taking a prestige class does not incur the experience point penalties normally associated with multiclassing.

### Definitions of Terms

Here are definitions of some terms used in this section.

**Base Class:** One of the standard eleven classes.

**Caster Level:** Generally equal to the number of class levels (see below) in a spellcasting class. Some prestige classes add caster levels to an existing class.

**Character Level:** The total level of the character, which is the sum of all class levels held by that character.

**Class Level:** The level of a character in a particular class. For a character with levels in only one class, class level and character level are the same.
