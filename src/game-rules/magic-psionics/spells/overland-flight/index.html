        <p><strong>Level:</strong> Sor/Wiz 5</p>
        <p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S</p>
        <p><strong>Range:</strong> Personal</p>
        <p><strong>Target:</strong> You</p>
        <p><strong>Duration:</strong> 1 hour/level</p>
        <p>This spell functions like a fly spell, except you can fly at a speed of 40 feet (30 feet if wearing medium or heavy armor, or if carrying a medium or heavy load) with average maneuverability. When using this spell for long-distance movement, you can hustle without taking nonlethal damage (a forced march still requires Constitution checks). This means you can cover 64 miles in an eight-hour period of flight (or 48 miles at a speed of 30 feet).</p>
