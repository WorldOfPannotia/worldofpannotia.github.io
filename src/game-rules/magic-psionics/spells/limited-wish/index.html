        <p><em>Universal</em></p>
        <p><strong>Level:</strong> Sor/Wiz 7</p>
        <p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, XP</p>
        <p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 standard action</p>
        <p><strong>Range:</strong> See text</p>
        <p><strong>Target, Effect, or Area: </strong> See text</p>
        <p><strong>Duration:</strong> See text</p>
        <p><strong>Saving Throw:</strong> None; see text</p>
        <p><strong>Spell Resistance:</strong> Yes</p>
        <p>A limited wish lets you create nearly any type of effect. For example, a limited wish can do any of the following things.</p>
<ul>
<li>Duplicate any sorcerer/wizard spell of 6th level or lower, provided the spell is not of a school prohibited to you.</li>
<li>Duplicate any other spell of 5th level or lower, provided the spell is not of a school prohibited to you.</li>
<li>Duplicate any sorcerer/wizard spell of 5th level or lower, even if it's of a prohibited school.</li>
<li>Duplicate any other spell of 4th level or lower, even if it's of a prohibited school.</li>
<li>Undo the harmful effects of many spells, such as geas/quest or insanity.</li>
<li>Produce any other effect whose power level is in line with the above effects, such as a single creature automatically hitting on its next attack or taking a -7 penalty on its next saving throw.</li>
</ul>
<p>A duplicated spell allows saving throws and spell resistance as normal (but the save DC is for a 7th-level spell). When a limited wish duplicates a spell that has an XP cost, you must pay that cost or 300 XP, whichever is more. When a limited wish spell duplicates a spell with a material component that costs more than 1,000 gp, you must provide that component.</p>
        <p><strong>XP Cost:</strong> 300 XP or more (see above).</p>
