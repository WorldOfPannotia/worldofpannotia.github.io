        <p>A black ray projects from your pointing finger. You must succeed on a ranged touch attack with the ray to strike a target.</p>
        <p>The subject is immediately exhausted for the spell's duration. A successful Fortitude save means the creature is only fatigued.</p>
        <p>A character that is already fatigued instead becomes exhausted.</p>
        <p>This spell has no effect on a creature that is already exhausted. Unlike normal exhaustion or fatigue, the effect ends as soon as the spell's duration expires.</p>
