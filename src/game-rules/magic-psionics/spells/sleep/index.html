        <p>A sleep spell causes a magical slumber to come upon 4 Hit Dice of creatures. Creatures with the fewest HD are affected first.</p>
        <p>Among creatures with equal HD, those who are closest to the spell's point of origin are affected first. Hit Dice that are not sufficient to affect a creature are wasted.</p>
        <p>Sleeping creatures are helpless. Slapping or wounding awakens an affected creature, but normal noise does not. Awakening a creature is a standard action (an application of the aid another action).</p>
        <p>Sleep does not target unconscious creatures, constructs, or undead creatures.</p>
        <p><em>Material Component:</em> A pinch of fine sand, rose petals, or a live cricket.</p>
