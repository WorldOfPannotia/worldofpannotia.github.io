        <p><em>Transmutation</em></p>
        <p><strong>Level:</strong> Sor/Wiz 6</p>
        <p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M</p>
        <p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 standard action</p>
        <p><strong>Range:</strong> Personal</p>
        <p><strong>Target:</strong> You</p>
        <p><strong>Duration:</strong> 1 round/level</p>
        <p>You become a virtual fighting machine-stronger, tougher, faster, and more skilled in combat. Your mind-set changes so that you relish combat and you can't cast spells, even from magic items.</p>
        <p>You gain a +4 enhancement bonus to Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution, a +4 natural armor bonus to AC, a +5 competence bonus on Fortitude saves, and proficiency with all simple and martial weapons. Your base attack bonus equals your character level (which may give you multiple attacks).</p>
        <p>You lose your spellcasting ability, including your ability to use spell trigger or spell completion magic items, just as if the spells were no longer on your class list.</p>
        <p><em>Material Component:</em> A potion of bull's strength, which you drink (and whose effects are subsumed by the spell effects).</p>
