        <p><em>Enchantment (Compulsion) [Mind-Affecting]</em></p>
        <p><strong>Level:</strong> Clr 5, Sor/Wiz 5</p>
        <p><strong>Saving Throw:</strong> Will negates</p>
        <p>This spell functions like symbol of death, except that all creatures of 10 HD or less within 60 feet of the symbol of sleep instead fall into a catatonic slumber for 3d6x10 minutes. Unlike with the sleep spell, sleeping creatures cannot be awakened by nonmagical means before this time expires.</p>
        <p>Unlike symbol of death, symbol of sleep has no hit point limit; once triggered, a symbol of sleep simply remains active for 10 minutes per caster level.</p>
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> Magic traps such as symbol of sleep are hard to detect and disable. A rogue (only) can use the Search skill to find a symbol of sleep and Disable Device to thwart it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 30 for symbol of sleep.</p>
        <p><em>Material Component:</em> Mercury and phosphorus, plus powdered diamond and opal with a total value of at least 1,000 gp.</p>
