        <p><strong>Level:</strong> Brd 1, Sor/Wiz 1</p>
        <p><strong>Components:</strong> V</p>
        <p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 immediate action</p>
        <p><strong>Range:</strong> Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)</p>
        <p><strong>Targets:</strong> One Medium or smaller freefalling object or creature/level, no two of which may be more than 20 ft. apart</p>
        <p><strong>Duration:</strong> Until landing or 1 round/level</p>
        <p><strong>Saving Throw:</strong> Will negates (harmless) or Will negates (object)</p>
        <p><strong>Spell Resistance:</strong> Yes (object)</p>
        <p>The affected creatures or objects fall slowly. Feather fall instantly changes the rate at which the targets fall to a mere 60 feet per round (equivalent to the end of a fall from a few feet), and the subjects take no damage upon landing while the spell is in effect. However, when the spell duration expires, a normal rate of falling resumes.</p>
        <p>The spell affects one or more Medium or smaller creatures (including gear and carried objects up to each creature's maximum load) or objects, or the equivalent in larger creatures: A Large creature or object counts as two Medium creatures or objects, a Huge creature or object counts as two Large creatures or objects, and so forth.</p>
        <p>You can cast this spell with an instant utterance, quickly enough to save yourself if you unexpectedly fall. Casting the spell is a immediate action, allowing you to cast this spell even when it isn't your turn.</p>
        <p>This spell has no special effect on ranged weapons unless they are falling quite a distance. If the spell is cast on a falling item the object does half normal damage based on its weight, with no bonus for the height of the drop.</p>
        <p>Feather fall works only upon free-falling objects. It does not affect a sword blow or a charging or flying creature.</p>
