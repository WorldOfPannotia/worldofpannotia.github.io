        <p><em>Enchantment (Charm) [Mind-Affecting]</em></p>
        <p><strong>Level:</strong> Clr 6, Sor/Wiz 6</p>
        <p><strong>Saving Throw:</strong> Will negates</p>
        <p>This spell functions like symbol of death, except that all creatures within the radius of a symbol of persuasion instead become charmed by the caster (as the charm monster spell) for 1 hour per caster level.</p>
        <p>Unlike symbol of death, symbol of persuasion has no hit point limit; once triggered, a symbol of persuasion simply remains active for 10 minutes per caster level.</p>
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> Magic traps such as symbol of persuasion are hard to detect and disable. A rogue (only) can use the Search skill to find a symbol of persuasion and Disable Device to thwart it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 31 for symbol of persuasion.</p>
        <p><em>Material Component:</em> Mercury and phosphorus, plus powdered diamond and opal with a total value of at least 5,000 gp.</p>
