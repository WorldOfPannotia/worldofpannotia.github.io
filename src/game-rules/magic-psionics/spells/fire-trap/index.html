        <p><em>Abjuration [Fire]</em></p>

        <p><strong>Range:</strong> Touch</p>
        <p><strong>Target:</strong> Object touched</p>
        <p><strong>Duration:</strong> Permanent until discharged (D)</p>

        <p>Fire trap creates a fiery explosion when an intruder opens the item that the trap protects. A fire trap can ward any object that can be opened and closed.</p>
        <p>When casting fire trap, you select a point on the object as the spell's center. When someone other than you opens the object, a fiery explosion fills the area within a 5-foot radius around the spell's center. The flames deal 1d4 points of fire damage +1 point per caster level (maximum +20). The item protected by the trap is not harmed by this explosion.</p>
        <p>A fire trapped item cannot have a second closure or warding spell placed on it.</p>
        <p>A knock spell does not bypass a fire trap. An unsuccessful dispel magic spell does not detonate the spell.</p>
        <p>Underwater, this ward deals half damage and creates a large cloud of steam.</p>
        <p>You can use the fire trapped object without discharging it, as can any individual to whom the object was specifically attuned when cast. Attuning a fire trapped object to an individual usually involves setting a password that you can share with friends.</p>
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> Magic traps such as fire trap are hard to detect and disable. A rogue (only) can use the Search skill to find a fire trap and Disable Device to thwart it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level (DC 27 for a druid's fire trap or DC 29 for the arcane version).</p>
        <p><em>Material Component:</em> A half-pound of gold dust (cost 25 gp) sprinkled on the warded object.</p>
