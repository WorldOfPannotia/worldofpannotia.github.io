        <p><strong>Level:</strong> Drd 2</p>
        <p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S</p>
        <p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 standard action</p>
        <p><strong>Range:</strong> Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)</p>
        <p><strong>Target:</strong> 1 Small wooden object/level, all within a 20-ft. radius</p>
        <p><strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</p>
        <p><strong>Saving Throw:</strong> Will negates (object)</p>
        <p><strong>Spell Resistance:</strong> Yes (object)</p>
        <p>You cause wood to bend and warp, permanently destroying its straightness, form, and strength. A warped door springs open (or becomes stuck, requiring a Strength check to open, at your option). A boat or ship springs a leak. Warped ranged weapons are useless. A warped melee weapon causes a -4 penalty on attack rolls.</p>
        <p>You may warp one Small or smaller object or its equivalent per caster level. A Medium object counts as two Small objects, a Large object as four, a Huge object as eight, a Gargantuan object as sixteen, and a Colossal object as thirty-two.</p>
        <p>Alternatively, you can unwarp wood (effectively warping it back to normal) with this spell, straightening wood that has been warped by this spell or by other means. Make whole, on the other hand, does no good in repairing a warped item.</p>
        <p>You can combine multiple consecutive warp wood spells to warp (or unwarp) an object that is too large for you to warp with a single spell.</p>
        <p>Until the object is completely warped, it suffers no ill effects.</p>
