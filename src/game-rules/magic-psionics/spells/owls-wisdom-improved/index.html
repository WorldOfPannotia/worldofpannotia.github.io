        <p>The transmuted creature becomes wiser. The spell grants a +10 enhancement bonus to Wisdom, adding the usual benefit to Wisdom-related skills. Clerics, druids, paladins, and rangers (and other Wisdom-based spellcasters) who receive owl's wisdom do not gain any additional bonus spells for the increased Wisdom, but the saveDCs for their spells increase.</p>
        <p><em>Material Component:</em> A few feathers, or a pinch of droppings, from an owl.</p>
