        <p><strong>Level:</strong> Sor/Wiz 9</p>

        <p>This spell functions like interposing hand, except that the hand can interpose itself, push, or crush one opponent that you select.</p>
        <p>The crushing hand can grapple an opponent like grasping hand does. Its grapple bonus equals your caster level + your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier (for a wizard, cleric, or sorcerer, respectively), +12 for the hand's Strength score (35), +4 for being Large. The hand deals 2d6+12 points of damage (lethal, not nonlethal) on each successful grapple check against an opponent.</p>
        <p>The crushing hand can also interpose itself as interposing hand does, or it can bull rush an opponent as forceful hand does, but at a +18 bonus.</p>
        <p>Directing the spell to a new target is a move action.</p>
        <p>Clerics who cast this spell name it for their deities.</p>
        <p><em>Arcane Material Component:</em> The shell of an egg.</p>
        <p><em>Arcane Focus:</em> A glove of snakeskin.</p>
