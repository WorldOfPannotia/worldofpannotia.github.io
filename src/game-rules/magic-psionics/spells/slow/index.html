        <p>An affected creature moves and attacks at a drastically slowed rate. A slowed creature can take only a single move action or standard action each turn, but not both (nor may it take full-round actions). Additionally, it takes a -1 penalty on attack rolls, AC, and Reflex saves. A slowed creature moves at half its normal speed (round down to the next 5-foot increment), which affects the creature's jumping distance as normal for decreased speed.</p>
        <p>Multiple slow effects don't stack. Slow counters and dispels haste.</p>
        <p><em>Material Component:</em> A drop of molasses.</p>
