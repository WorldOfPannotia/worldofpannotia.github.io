        <p><em>Psychokinesis [Force]</em></p>
        <p><strong>Level:</strong> Psion/Wilder 4</p>
        <p><strong>Display:</strong> Visual</p>
        <p><strong>Manifesting Time:</strong> 1 standard action</p>
        <p><strong>Range:</strong> Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./ level)</p>
        <p><strong>Target:</strong> One creature</p>
        <p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 round/level</p>
        <p><strong>Saving Throw:</strong> None</p>
        <p><strong>Power Resistance:</strong> Yes</p>
        <p><strong>Power Points:</strong> 7</p>
        <p>You can affect a foe by concentrating your mind upon its current status and the status you desire, once per round. You can perform a bull rush, a disarm, a grapple (including a pin), or a trip. Resolve these attempts as normal, except that they don't provoke attacks of opportunity, you use your manifester level in place of your base attack bonus (for disarm and grapple attempts), you use your Intelligence modifier in place of your Strength modifier or Dexterity modifier, and a failed attempt doesn't allow a reactive attempt by the target (such as normally allowed on disarm or trip attempts). No save is allowed against these attempts, but power resistance applies normally.</p>
        <p><strong>Augment:</strong> For every 2 additional power points you spend, this power grants a +1 bonus on your checks involving bull rush, disarm, grapple, or trip attempts.</p>
