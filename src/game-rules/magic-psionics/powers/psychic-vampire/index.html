        <p><em>Psychometabolism</em></p>
        <p><strong>Level:</strong> Egoist 4, Psychic Warrior 4</p>
        <p><strong>Display:</strong> Mental</p>
        <p><strong>Manifesting Time:</strong> 1 standard action</p>
        <p><strong>Range:</strong> Touch</p>
        <p><strong>Target:</strong> Creature touched</p>
        <p><strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</p>
        <p><strong>Saving Throw:</strong> Fortitude negates</p>
        <p><strong>Power Resistance:</strong> Yes</p>
        <p><strong>Power Points:</strong> 7</p>
        <p>This power shrouds your hand or a natural weapon you possess with darkness that you can use to drain an opponent's power.</p>
        <p>If you manifest this power to affect your hand, the next successful melee touch attack you make (if the victim fails its Fortitude save) drains 2 power points from your foe for every manifester level you have. The drained points simply dissipate. Your touch attack, charged with psionic power, is treated as an armed attack.</p>
        <p>If you manifest this power to affect a natural weapon you possess, you must make a successful melee attack with the weapon to gain the power's benefit.</p>
        <p>Against a psionic being that has no power points or a nonpsionic foe, your attack instead deals 2 points of Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma damage (your choice).</p>
