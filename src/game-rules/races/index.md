### Favored Class {#favored-class}

A character's favored class doesn't count against him or her when determining experience point penalties for multiclassing.

### Race and Languages {#race-and-languages}

All player characters know how to speak Common. Many races also have their own language, which player characters of those races speak, as appropriate. A character who has an Intelligence bonus at 1st level speaks other languages as well. See the {% skill_link speak-language %} skill for a detailed explanation of learning languages.

Class-Related Languages: Clerics, druids, and wizards can choose certain languages as bonus languages even if they're not on the lists found in the race descriptions. These class-related languages are as follows:

 * _Cleric:_ Abyssal, Celestial, Infernal.
 * _Druid:_ Sylvan.
 * _Wizard:_ Draconic.

### Small Characters {#small-cahracters}

A Small character gets a +1 size bonus to Armor Class, a +1 size bonus on attack rolls, and a +4 size bonus on {% skill_link hide %} checks. A Small character's carrying capacity is three-quarters of that of a Medium character.

A Small character generally moves about two-thirds as fast as a Medium character.

A Small character must use smaller weapons than a Medium character.
