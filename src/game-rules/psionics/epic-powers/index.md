The following adjustments should be made if taking psionic characters to epic levels.

### Epic Psionic Seeds

Psionic characters can acquire epic powers. Generally, all the [epic spell rules]({{ site.url }}/game-rules/magic/epic-spells/) work for epic powers as well, except as noted below for displays.

Psionic characters take the Epic Manifestation feat, which works just like the Epic Spellcasting feat. The prerequisites for this feat are 24 ranks of Psicraft, 24 ranks of Knowledge (psionics), and the ability to manifest 9th-level psionic powers.

Just as spellcasters use no spell slots to cast epic spells, psionic characters use no power points to manifest epic powers. Instead, they freely manifest their known epic powers a number of times per day equal to their Knowledge (psionics) skill divided by 10 (round down).
