  description: |
    An elaborate crystalline psicrown etched with strange designs, this exceptional psicrown is so invested with power that it is considered an artifact.

    The power points in the _Psicrown of the Crystal Mind_ can be used to manifest any of the following powers at manifester level 20th (or at the wearer's manifester level if it is higher than 20th).

     * _Burst_
     * _Catfall_
     * _Concealing amorpha, greater_
     * _Concussion blast_
     * _Daze, psionic_
     * _Detect psionics_
     * _Dominate, psionic_
     * _Far hand_
     * _Float_
     * _Mindlink_
     * _Inertial barrier_
     * _Telekinetic force_
     * _Telekinetic maneuver_
     * _Telekinetic thrust_
     * _Teleport, psionic_
     * _Thicken skin_
     * _True metabolism_

    The wearer of the _Psicrown of the Crystal Mind_ also gains power resistance equal to 10 + his manifester level.

    The _Psicrown of the Crystal Mind_ has 1,000 power points when discovered. Anyone who dons the crown instantly knows the number of power points it has at the current time. The crown recharges itself, gaining back 1 power point per day if it currently has fewer than 1,000 points.

    As a special one-time use of the psicrown, the wearer can channel all the remaining charges in the psicrown into an uncontrolled burst of energy. The wearer triggers this use as a standard action. All within 20 feet of the wearer take hit points of damage equal to half the power points left in the staff (Reflex DC 18 half). The wearer inhabits a tiny eye of calm at the center of the destruction and is unharmed, but the psicrown is reduced to a burned-out cinder.
