  description: |
    The _Cup_ is a large gem-set golden chalice requiring two hands to lift. It emits light (as the {% spell_link daylight %} spell) at all times and automatically dispels any darkness-based spells whose area it enters. If the cup is filled with holy water (requiring a full gallon), that substance will act as a _potion of cure critical wounds_ or a _potion of neutralize poison_ (owner's choice) if drunk. This liquid can't be saved or stored in any way. The _Talisman_ is a small eight-pointed platinum star hanging from a chain of gold and pearls. The wearer gains a +6 enhancement bonus to Charisma and may cast _remove blindness/deafness, remove curse_, and {% spell_link remove-disease %} at will. Furthermore, if the _Talisman_ is placed within the _Cup_ and the _Cup_ filled with holy water, that liquid acts as a special elixir of {% spell_link resurrection %} (as the spell). This effect will function only once per month. Any evil or chaotic creature that touches the _Cup_ or _Talisman_ is struck with a {% spell_link holy-word %} (if evil) or {% spell_link dictum %} (if chaotic) spell (or both if the creature is chaotic evil).
