  description: |
    This treatise contains expert advice and instruction in the arts of combat. Any barbarian, fighter, monk, paladin, or ranger who spends one week studying the manual gains a +1 inherent bonus to Strength and experience points sufficient to place him or her halfway into the next level of experience. (If the reader has levels in more than one of the classes listed, he or she must choose one of the classes to be affected.) A character without any levels in one of the classes listed gains no bonus from the work, but if an arcane spellcaster without levels in one of the classes listed scans even a single word he or she will lose 2d&times;1,000 XP and must make a Will save (DC 20) or have 1 point of Intelligence permanently drained. Except as indicated above, the writing in a _manual of puissant skill at arms_ can't be distinguished from any other book, libram, tome, or so on until perused. Once read, the book vanishes, never to be seen again, nor can the same character ever benefit from reading a similar tome a second time.
