  description: |
    A talisman of this sort appears the same as a _stone of controlling earth elementals_. Its powers are quite different, however, and dependent on the Charisma of the individual holding the talisman. Whenever a character touches a _talisman of reluctant wishes_, he must make a DC 15 Charisma check.

    If he fails, the device acts as a _stone of weight_. Discarding or destroying it results in {% die_roll 5 6 0 %} points of damage to the character and the disappearance of the talisman.

    If he succeeds, the talisman remains with the character for {% die_roll 5 6 0 %} hours, or until a {% spell_link wish %} is made with it, whichever comes first. It then disappears.

    If he rolls a natural 20, the character finds it impossible to be rid of the talisman for as many months as he has points of Charisma. In addition, the artifact grants him one {% spell_link wish %} for every 6 points of the character's Charisma. It also grows warm and throbs whenever its possessor comes within 20 feet of a mechanical or magic trap. (If the talisman is not held, its warning heat and pulses are of no avail.)

    Regardless of which reaction results, a _talisman of reluctant wishes_ disappears when its time period expires, leaving behind a 10,000 gp diamond in its stead.
