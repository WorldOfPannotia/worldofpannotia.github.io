  description: |
    Each of these fabled orbs contains the essence and personality of an ancient dragon of a different variety (one for each of the major ten different chromatic and metallic dragons). The bearer of an _Orb_ can _dominate_ dragons of its particular variety within 500 feet (as {% spell_link dominate-monster %}), the dragon being forced to make a DC 25 Will save to resist. (Spell resistance is not useful against this effect.) Each _Orb of Dragonkind_ bestows upon the wielder the AC and saving throw bonuses of the dragon within. These values replace whatever values the character would otherwise have, whether they are better or worse. These values cannot be modified by any means short of ridding the character of the _Orb_. A character possessing an _Orb of Dragonkind_ is immune to the breath weapon &ndash; but only the breath weapon &ndash; of the dragon variety keyed to the _Orb_. Finally, a character possessing an _Orb_ can herself use the breath weapon of the dragon in the _Orb_ three times per day.

    All _Orbs of Dragonkind_ can be used to communicate verbally and visually with the possessors of the other _Orbs_. The owner of an _Orb_ knows whether there are dragons within 10 miles at all times. For dragons of the _Orb_'s particular variety, the range is 100 miles. If within 1 mile of a dragon of the _Orb_'s variety, the wielder can determine the exact location and age of the creature. The bearer of one of these _Orbs_ earns the enmity forever of all dragonkind for profiting by the enslavement of one of their kin, even if she later loses the item.

    Each _Orb_ also has an individual power that can be invoked once per round at 10th caster level.

     * _Black Dragon Orb: Fly_ (Will DC 17 negates).
     * _Blue Dragon Orb: Haste_ (Fortitude DC 17 negates).
     * _Brass Dragon Orb: Teleport_ (Will DC 19 negates).
     * _Bronze Dragon Orb: Scrying_ (Will DC 18 negates).
     * _Copper Dragon Orb: Suggestion_ (Will DC 17 negates).
     * _Gold Dragon Orb:_ The owner of the gold _Orb_ can call upon any power possessed by one of the other _Orbs_ &ndash; including the _dominate_ and breath weapon abilities but not AC, save bonuses, or breath weapon immunity &ndash; but can only use an individual power once per day. She can use _dominate_ on any other possessor of an _Orb_ within 1 mile (Will DC 23 negates).
     * _Green Dragon Orb: Spectral hand_.
     * _Red Dragon Orb: Wall of fire_.
     * _Silver Dragon Orb: Cure critical wounds_ (Will DC 18 half ).
     * _White Dragon Orb: Protection from energy (cold)_ (Fortitude DC 17 negates).
