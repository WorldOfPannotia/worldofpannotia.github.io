  description: |
    This mystic book is of great value to arcane spellcasters of neutral alignment (LN, N, CN). Study of the work requires one week. Upon completion, the neutral arcane caster gains a +1 inherent bonus to the ability score controlling his or her arcane spellcasting ability and experience points sufficient to place him or her halfway into the next level of experience. (If the reader has levels in more than one arcane spellcasting class, he or she must choose one of the classes to be affected.) Evil or good arcane spellcasters (LE, NE, CE, LG, NG, or CG) are permanently drained of 1d4+1 points of Constitution and must atone (see the {% spell_link atonement %} spell) in order to gain any further experience. Anyone incapable of casting arcane spells who reads even a single word of the work must make a Will save (DC 20) or suffer insanity (see the {% spell_link insanity %} spell). Except as indicated above, the writing in a _libram of silver magic_ can't be distinguished from any other book, libram, tome, or so on until perused. Once read, the book vanishes, never to be seen again, nor can the same character ever benefit from reading a similar tome a second time.
