  description: |
    This _+3 Large returning warhammer_ deals 4d6 points of damage on any hit. Further, if the wielder wears a _belt of giant Strength_ and _gauntlets of ogre power_ and he knows that the hammer is a _hammer of thunderbolts_ (not just a _+3 warhammer_), the weapon can be used to full effect: It gains a total +5 enhancement bonus, allows all _belt_ and _gauntlet_ bonuses to stack (only when using this weapon), and strikes dead any giant upon whom it scores a hit (Fortitude DC 20 negates the death effect but not the damage).

    When hurled, on a successful attack the hammer emits a great noise, like a clap of thunder, causing all creatures within 90 feet to be stunned for 1 round (Fortitude DC 15 negates). The hammer's range increment is 30 feet.
