  description: |
    An evil (LE, NE, CE) divine spellcaster who possesses this item can cause a flaming crack to open at the feet of a good (LG, NG, CG) divine spellcaster who is up to 100 feet away. The intended victim is swallowed up forever and sent hurtling to the center of the earth. The wielder of the talisman must be evil, and if she is not exceptionally foul and perverse in the sights of her evil deity the good character gains a DC 19 Reflex save to leap away from the crack. Obviously, the target must be standing on solid ground for this item to function.

    A _talisman of ultimate evil_ has 6 charges. If a neutral (LN, N, CN) divine spellcaster touches one of these stones, she takes {% die_roll 6 6 0 %} points of damage. If a good divine spellcaster touches one, she takes {% die_roll 8 6 0 %} points of damage. All other characters are unaffected by the device.
