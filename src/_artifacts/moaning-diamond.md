  description: |
    The _Moaning Diamond_ appears to be an uncut diamond the size of a human fist. At all times, it gives forth a baleful moaning sound, as if in pain. Despite the noise, the _Moaning Diamond_ is not evil. The wielder of the stone can, three times per day, call upon it to reshape earth and stone as if by the spell _stone shape_, affecting 5,000 cubic feet of material. The _Moaning Diamond_ can summon an elder earth elemental with maximum hit points that serves the caster until it is slain. Only one such elemental can be summoned at a time; if it is slain, a new creature cannot be summoned for 24 hours.
