  description: |
    This relic appears to be a simple, well-used cudgel, but its simple appearance hides great power. The _saint's mace_ has a +5 enhancement bonus and functions as a heavy mace with the holy, lawful, and disruption special abilities. The wielder can project _searing light_ from the mace at will, at caster level 20th.
