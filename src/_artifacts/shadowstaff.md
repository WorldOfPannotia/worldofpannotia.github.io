  description: |
    This artifact was crafted centuries ago, weaving together the wispy strands of shadow itself into a twisted black staff. The _Shadowstaff_ makes the wielder slightly shadowy and incorporeal, granting him a +4 bonus to AC and Reflex saves (which stacks with any other bonuses). However, in bright light (such as that of the sun, but not a torch) or in absolute darkness, the wielder takes a â€“2 penalty on all attack rolls, saves, and checks.

    The _Shadowstaff_ also has these powers.

     * _Summon Shadows:_ Three times per day the staff may summon 2d4 shadows. Immune to turning, they serve the wielder as if called by a {% spell_link summon-monster-V %} spell cast at 20th level.
     * _Summon Nightshade:_ Once per month, the staff can summon a nightcrawler nightshade that serves the wielder as if called by a {% spell_link summon-monster-IX %} spell cast at 20th level.
     * _Shadow Form:_ Three times per day the wielder can become a living shadow, with all the movement powers granted by the {% spell_link gaseous-form %} spell.
     * _Shadow Bolt:_ Three times per day the staff can project a ray attack that deals 10d6 points of cold damage to a single target. The shadow bolt has a range of 100 feet.
