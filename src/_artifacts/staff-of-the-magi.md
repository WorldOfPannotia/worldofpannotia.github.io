  description: |
    A long wooden staff, shod in iron and inscribed with sigils and runes of all types, this potent artifact contains many spell powers and other functions. Some of its powers use charges, while others don't. The following powers do not use charges:

     * _Detect magic_
     * {% spell_link enlarge-person %} (Fortitude DC 15 negates)
     * _Hold portal_
     * _Light_
     * _Mage armor_
     * _Mage hand_

    The following powers drain 1 charge per usage:

     * _Dispel magic_
     * {% spell_link fireball %} ({% die_roll 10 6 0 %} damage, Reflex DC 17 half )
     * {% spell_link ice-storm %}
     * {% spell_link invisibility %}
     * _Knock_
     * {% spell_link lightning-bolt %} ({% die_roll 10 6 0 %} damage, Reflex DC 17 half )
     * _Passwall_
     * {% spell_link pyrotechnics %} (Will or Fortitude DC 16 negates)
     * _Wall of fire_
     * _Web_

    These powers drain 2 charges per usage:

     * _Monster summoning IX_
     * {% spell_link plane-shift %} (Will DC 21 negates)
     * {% spell_link telekinesis %} (400 lb. maximum weight; Will DC 19 negates)

    A _staff of the magi_ gives the wielder spell resistance 23. If this is willingly lowered, however, the staff can also be used to absorb arcane spell energy directed at its wielder, as a _rod of absorption_ does. Unlike the rod, this staff converts spell levels into charges rather than retaining them as spell energy usable by a spellcaster. If the staff absorbs enough spell levels to exceed its limit of 50 charges, it explodes as if a retributive strike had been performed (see below). The wielder has no idea how many spell levels are cast at her, for the staff does not communicate this knowledge as a _rod of absorption_ does. (Thus, absorbing spells can be risky.)

    _Retributive Strike:_ A _staff of the magi_ can be broken for a retributive strike. Such an act must be purposeful and declared by the wielder. All charges in the staff are released in a 30-foot spread. All within 10 feet of the broken staff take hit points of damage equal to 8 times the number of charges in the staff, those between 11 feet and 20 feet away take points equal to 6 times the number of charges, and those 21 feet to 30 feet distant take 4 times the number of charges. A DC 17 Reflex save reduces damage by half.

    The character breaking the staff has a 50% chance (01–50 on d%) of traveling to another plane of existence, but if she does not (51–100), the explosive release of spell energy destroys her. Only specific items, including the _staff of the magi_ and the _staff of power_ are capable of a retributive strike.
