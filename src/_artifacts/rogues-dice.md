  description: |
    This pair of cubes appears much like any other pair of typical (6-sided) dice. A character with a pair of _rogue's dice_ who wishes to roll them must announce that he or she is rolling the dice (accidental rolls have no effect). Rolling the dice is a standard action, and both dice must be rolled simultaneously to have any effect. The player should roll 2d6 and consult the table below to determine the _dice's_ affects.

    |---
    | 2d6 | Effect
    |-|-
    | 2 | Lose 10,000 XP and dice roll again next round
    | 3 | Permanently lose 1d4+1 Dex
    | 4 | Gain 1d4 negative levels (Fortitude DC 20 to remove)
    | 5 | –1 penalty on all attacks, saves, and checks for 1 hour
    | 6 | –4 penalty to AC for 10 minutes
    | 7 | +1 morale bonus on attacks and on saves against fear for 10 minutes
    | 8 | Gain effects of _blur_ for 10 minutes
    | 9 | +1 insight bonus on all attacks, saves, and checks for 1 hour
    | 10 | Gain effects of _freedom of movement_ for 1 hour
    | 11 | Gain one _limitedwish_ (must be used within 1 minute)
    | 12 | Gain 10,000 XP and may roll again next round

    No character can gain any effect from an additional roll of the dice within 24 hours, with two exceptions. If a 2 is rolled, the dice automatically roll themselves at the beginning of the character's next turn and he or she must accept the additional result. If a 12 is rolled, the character may choose to roll again in the next round (if more than 1 full round elapses between the roll of 12 and this bonus roll, the character loses the bonus roll). There is no method (mundane or magical) to predict or influence the result of a roll of _Rogue's dice_. Even powerful divination magic can't predict the outcome of a roll before it is made.
