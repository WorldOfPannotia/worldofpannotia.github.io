  description: |
    The _Codex_ is enormous &ndash; supposedly, it requires two strong men to lift it. No matter how many pages are turned, another always remains. Anyone opening the _Codex_ for the first time is utterly annihilated, as with a _destruction_ spell (Fortitude DC 30 for only 10d6 damage). Those who survive can peruse its pages and learn its powers, though not without risk. Each day spent studying the _Codex_ allows the reader to make a Spellcraft check (DC 50) to learn one of its powers (choose the power learned randomly; add a +1 circumstance bonus on the check per additional day spent reading until a power is learned). However, each day of study also forces the reader to make a Will save (DC 30 + 1 per day of study) to avoid being driven insane (as the _insanity_ spell). The powers of the _Codex of the Infinite Planes_ are as follows: _astral projection, banishment, elemental swarm, gate, greater planar ally, greater planar binding, plane shift_, and _soul bind_. Each is usable at will by the owner of the _Codex_ (assuming that he or she has learned how to access the power). The _Codex of the Infinite Planes_ has a caster level of 30th for the purposes of all powers and catastrophes, and all saving throw DCs are 20 + spell level. Activating any power requires both a Concentration check and a Spellcraft check (DC 40 + twice the spell level of the power; the character can't take 10 on this check). Any failure on either check indicates a catastrophe befalls the user (roll on the table below for the effect). A character can only incur one catastrophe per power use, even if he or she fails both checks.
