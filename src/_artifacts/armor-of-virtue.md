  description: |
    The Armor of Virtue is made of mithril and comes in seven pieces. If all seven pieces are worn, the wearer takes none of the penalties incurred, but retains all bonuses and also gains the following:

     * Smite evil 3/day - treat the wearer as being +15 HD for the purpose of determining the bonus damage dealt.
     * Damage reduction 50 / epic and evil
     * When wearing all seven pieces of the Armor of Virtue, the wearer is considered to be wearing full plate instead of breastplate, as noted in the description of the Breastplate of Fortitude.

    The seven pieces of the Armor of Virtue are as follows:

    _Helmet of Prudence_

    Benefit: The wearer of this helmet is able to channel her foresight with amazing results. Twice per day, she can add her sense motive modifier as a luck bonus to her Armor Class for a round. Activating this ability is a free action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. When worn with all six other pieces of the Armor of Virtue, this ability can be used five times per day.

    Penalty: Because the wearer of the Helmet of Prudence focuses not on attack, but on studying her adversary, the wearer of the helmet takes a -4 penalty on Initiative checks and a -2 penalty to attack rolls as long as the helmet is worn.

    _Medallion of Faith_

    Benefit: The wearer of this medallion gains a +6 divine bonus to Will saves to resist charms, compulsions, or mind-affecting effects. This stacks with any other racial, magical or class bonuses the wearer may have. When worn with all six other pieces of the Armor of Virtue, the wearer is instead immune to these effects.

    Penalty: Divine intervention often does not come without some cost. As long as the medallion is worn, the wearer takes a -2 penalty to Strength and Constitution. This represents the wearer letting go of the physical world and placing faith in the divine.

    _Bracers of Justice_

    Benefit: Twice per day, the wearer of these bracers can use a mark of justice spell. This spell is cast as a 10th level cleric and has a casting time of 10 minutes. When the bracers are worn with the rest of the Armor of Virtue, the caster level is increased to 20.

    Penalty: The wearer of these bracers is herself subject to a mark of justice spell, though only while wearing the bracers. If she commits any acts that are not lawful or good, she must succeed in a Will saving throw vs DC 30 or suffer two of the effects of a bestow curse spell (roll to determine which effects). These affects cannot be reversed except through an atonement spell.

    Special: Even when worn with all six other pieces of the Armor of Virtue, the wearer of these bracers is still under the effect of the mark of justice spell. The wearer must at all times be vigilant of her actions.

    _Breastplate of Fortitude_

    Benefit: This breastplate has a +4 enhancement bonus and the abilities light fortification and wand bearing. When worn with all six other pieces of the Armor of Virtue, the enhancement bonus increases to +5, light fortification becomes moderate fortification, and the armor also grants the wearer immunity to death spells, magical death effects, energy drain, and negative energy effects (such as chill touch or inflict spells).

    Penalty: The wearer of this breastplate takes a -5 penalty to reflex saves made while the armor is worn.

    _Ring of Hope_

    Benefit: This ring provides the wearer a +2 enhancement bonus to Charisma as well as a +4 bonus to saves vs fear affects. When worn with all six other pieces of the Armor of Virtue, the Charisma bonus increases to +6 and the save bonus to +8.

    Penalty: The wearer of this ring is hopeful to a fault. She takes a -5 penalty on diplomacy and sense motive checks when wearing the ring because of her belief that there must be some good in all creatures.

    _Gloves of Self Sacrifice_

    Benefit: The wearer of these gloves is quick in action and virtuous in deed. She gains a +6 bonus to Dexterity. When worn with all six other pieces of the Armor of Virtue, the bonus increases to +10.

    Penalty: The wearer of these gloves must be willing to pay the ultimate price for the good of others. Whenever she is in a position to save another creature from injury or death (except in the case of direct combat with an evil creature), she must succeed on a Will saving throw DC 30 or spring to the aid of the individual in danger.

    _Boots of Temperance_

    Benefit: The wearer of these boots is capable of showing remarkable restraint. She gains a +4 bonus to Will saves to resist compulsion or charm effects, a +4 bonus to opposed strength checks to avoid being tripped or bull rushed, and she is able to deal subdual damage instead of lethal with any attack she makes. When worn with all six other pieces of the Armor of Virtue, the bonuses increase to +8.

    Penalty: The wearer of these boots sacrifices a single attack during her full round attack option. This attack is at the highest attack bonus. For example, a 16th level paladin with a strength of 18 wearing these boots would normally have an attack bonus of +20/+15/+10. Instead, this bonus becomes +15/+10 during a full attack.
