  description: |
    This monastic tome describes ancient techniques of mental focus and is highly prized by psionic practitioners. If a psionic character who is not evil studies the work during one week of solitary contemplation, he gains 17 bonus power points and experience points sufficient to place him halfway into the next level of experience. Those who use their powers for evil are punished for their impertinence, losing {% die_roll 5 6 0 %} &times; 1,000 XP for defiling the book. In addition, an evil reader must make an immediate DC 15 Will save or become permanently _confused_ as if affected by the {% spell_link insanity %} power. Only _psychic chirurgery_ or similarly extreme measures can restore sanity.

    The minds of nonpsionic beings are too clouded to benefit from the secrets of this book. To anyone without psionic aptitude, the book's pages appear to contain nothing but elaborate patterns and drawings of mysterious beings. Once it is read, the book vanishes into the Astral Plane to an unknown destination. Even if it is found again, the same character cannot benefit twice from perusing its contents.
