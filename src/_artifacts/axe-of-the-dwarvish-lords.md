  description: |
    This is a _+6 keen throwing goblinoid bane dwarven waraxe_. Any dwarf who holds it doubles the range of his or her darkvision. Any nondwarf who grasps the _Axe_ takes 2 points of temporary Charisma damage; these points cannot be healed or restored in any way while the _Axe_ is held. The current owner of the _Axe_ gains a +10 bonus on Craft (armorsmithing, blacksmithing, gemcutting, stonemasonry, and weaponsmithing) checks. The wielder of the _Axe_ can summon an elder earth elemental (as {% spell_link summon-monster-ix %}; duration 20 rounds) once per week.
