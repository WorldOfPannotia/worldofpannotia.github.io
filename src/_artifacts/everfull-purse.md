  description: |
    This leather belt pouch has the power to turn a single gold coin into many overnight. If a single gold piece is placed in the _everfull purse_ at sunset, it will be replaced at sunrise by 25 gold pieces. The _purse_ has no effect if more than one gold piece is left within, or if anything other than gold is placed within.
