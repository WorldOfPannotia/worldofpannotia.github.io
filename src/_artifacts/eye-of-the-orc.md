  description: |
    This lump of rock has a marquis-cut black sapphire set in its center, making it appear similar to a large eye. If possessed by an orc, it grants a +6 enhancement bonus to Strength and Charisma, and the orc's darkvision range is doubled. Nonorcs who possess the _Eye_ gain a +2 enhancement bonus to Strength but take a â€“2 penalty to Intelligence and Charisma. Regardless of the owner's race, any weapon wielded by the owner of the _Eye_ is considered an _elf bane weapon_. Furthermore, by holding the _Eye_ before the character, he or she can perceive things as if he or she had _true seeing_ cast upon him or her. This can be activated only once per day but lasts as long as the character concentrates on it (requiring a standard action each round).
