  description: |
    This +14 keen speed fiery blast bloodletting longsword is made of star metal. The pommel is made out of ivory and is carved into the shape of a red dragon's neck and head. Inset into the eyes of the dragon head are rubies. These glow with a faint light at all times, even in complete magical darkness.

    In addition to its regular functions, Dathfunimae has the following abilities: 3 times per day, the wielder can cast an intensified flame strike (180 fire damage) as a standard action. Also, the sword functions as a Rod of the Wyrm attuned to a red dragon, except that the dragon the sword turns into is a Great Wyrm.
