This rod is similar to a {% rod_link lordly-might %}, although it is far more powerful. It is larger than its normal counterpart, and it is constructed of adamantine rather than normal metal. It has six buttons, several spell-like functions, and several mundane uses, and it can also be used as a magic weapon of various sorts.
The following spell-like functions of the rod can each be used once per day.
     * _Dominate Person:_ Touched foe is recipient of a {% spell_link dominate-person %} spell, if the wielder so commands (Will save DC 24). The wielder must choose to use this power and then succeed with a melee touch attack to activate the power. If the attack fails, the effect is lost.
     * _Stun:_ Upon command, all enemies viewing the rod are stunned, as per the {% spell_link power-word-stun %} spell (10-foot maximum range, Will save DC 24). Invoking this power is a standard action.
     * _Damage:_ Upon command, the rod deals 10d8 points of damage to an opponent on a successful touch attack and cures the wielder of a like amount of damage (Will save DC 26). The wielder must choose to use this power before attacking, as with {% spell_link dominate-person %} .
The following weapon uses of the rod have no limits on their use.
     * In its normal form, the rod can be used as a _+6 heavy mace_.
     * When button 1 is pushed, the rod becomes a _+3 longsword of fiery blasting_.
     * When button 2 is pushed, the rod becomes a _+8 battleaxe_.
     * When button 3 is pushed, the rod becomes a _+10 shortspear_ or _+10 longspear_.
The following mundane uses of the rod also have no limits on their use.
     * Climbing pole/ladder: When button 4 is pushed, a spike that can anchor in granite is extruded from the ball, while the other end sprouts three sharp hooks. The rod lengthens to anywhere between 5 and 150 feet in a single round, stopping when button 4 is pushed again. Horizontal bars 3 inches long fold out from the sides, 1 foot apart, in staggered progression. The rod is firmly held by the spike and hooks and can bear up to 10,000 pounds. The wielder can retract the pole by pushing button 5.
     * The ladder function can be used to force open doors. The wielder plants the rod's base 30 feet or less from the portal to be forced and in line with it, then pushes button 4. The force exerted has a Strength bonus of +24.
     * When button 6 is pushed, the rod indicates magnetic north and gives the wielder a knowledge of his or her approximate depth beneath the surface or height above it.
