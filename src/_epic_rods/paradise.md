  description: |
    This item creates a nondimensional space, similar in effect to a {% rod_link security %}. However, the rod's possessor and up to 999 other creatures can stay in complete safety for up to 1,000 days divided by the number of creatures affected. Natural healing takes place at five times the normal pace. The rod functions like its nonepic counterpart in all other ways.
