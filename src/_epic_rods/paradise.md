This item creates a nondimensional space, similar in effect to a _rod of securit_y. However, the rod's possessor and up to 999 other creatures can stay in complete safety for up to 1,000 days divided by the number of creatures affected. Natural healing takes place at five times the normal pace. The rod functions like its nonepic counterpart in all other ways.
Craft Rod, Craft Epic Rod, Improved Heighten Spell, improved heightened _gate_; _Market Price:_ 610,000 gp.
