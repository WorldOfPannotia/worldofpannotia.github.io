  description: |
    This rod functions as a _+3 light mace_. In addition, it is useful for besieging fortifications. Whenever the wielder makes a charge attack, the rod improves to a +6 weapon. Twice per day, the rod can create a battering ram that lasts for 24 rounds. This ram can strike once per round, dealing 20 points of damage with each hit. It cannot be used to target individuals, only fortifications. It can be damaged by normal means (65 hp, AC 22), and _disintegrate_ or _dispel magic_ destroys it. The rod also has the following powers:

     * _Siege Engine_: One heavy catapult, two light catapults, or three siege towers may be generated with each use of this power. Each weapon created lasts for 12 hours.The power can be used three times per day. Ammunition for 20 shots is included with each weapon created.
     * {% spell_link transmute-rock-to-mud %}: This power can be used three times per day (caster level 24th, save DC 17).
