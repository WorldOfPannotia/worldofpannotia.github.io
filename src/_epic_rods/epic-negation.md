  description: |
    This rod negates the spell or spell-like function or functions of magic items, including epic magic items (but not artifacts). The wielder points the rod at the magic item, and a beam shoots forth to touch the target device, attacking as a ray (a ranged touch attack). The ray negates any currently active item function and has a 75% chance to negate any other spell or spell-like functions of that device, regardless of the level or power of the functions, for {% die_roll 2 4 0 %} rounds. To negate instantaneous effects, the rod wielder needs to have readied an action. The target item gets no saving throw or means to resist this effect. The rod can function three times per day.
