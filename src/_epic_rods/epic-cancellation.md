  description: |
    This rod's touch drains an item of all magical properties, including the magical energy in epic magic items (but not most artifacts). The item touched gets a Will saving throw (DC 26). If a creature is holding the magic item at the time, then the item can use the holder's Will save bonus in place of its own. In such cases, contact is established by making a melee touch attack roll. Upon draining three items, the rod becomes brittle and useless. Drained items can only be restored by {% spell_link wish %}, {% spell_link miracle %}, or epic spells specifically designed to restore lost power. A _rod of epic cancellation_ can neutralize a normal _sphere of annihilation_ without itself being cancelled.
