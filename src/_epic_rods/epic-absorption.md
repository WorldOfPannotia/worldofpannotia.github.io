Like a _rod of absorption,_ this rod draws single-target or ray spells and spell-like abilities into itself, nullifying the effect and storing the potential spell levels until the wielder releases the energy in the form of spells of his or her own. Spells of any level (including those boosted beyond 9th level by metamagic) can be absorbed, although epic spells cannot. The rod absorbs a maximum of 150 spell levels and can thereafter only discharge any remaining potential it might have. The rod cannot be recharged.
