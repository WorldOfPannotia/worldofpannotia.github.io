  description: |
    This shield functions like a _shield of arrow deflection_, though it can deflect any number of projectiles or thrown weapons each round. Any time the bearer would normally be struck by a ranged weapon, he or she can make a Reflex saving throw (DC 20). If the ranged weapon has an enhancement bonus, the DC increases by that amount. If he or she succeeds, the shield deflects the weapon. The bearer must be aware of the attack and not flat-footed. Attempting to deflect a ranged weapon doesn't count as an action. Exceptional ranged weapons, such as boulders hurled by giants or ranged spells, can't be deflected.
