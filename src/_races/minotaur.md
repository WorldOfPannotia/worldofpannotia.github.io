      type: "Ex"
      desc: "A minotaur typically begins a battle by charging at an opponent, lowering its head to bring its mighty horns into play. In addition to the normal benefits and hazards of a charge, this allows the beast to make a single gore attack at its highest attack bonus that deals 4d6+(1 &#189; Str mod) points of damage."

      type: "Ex"
