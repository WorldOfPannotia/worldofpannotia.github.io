  lands: "Thaellegoth have no lands of their own. They are treated like vermin by nearly everyone in Pannotia, and they tend to live secluded lives in forests or the far north. Those thaellegoth who do manage to scrape out a living among other races are likely to live in barely habitable buildings and work as thugs-for-hire, bodyguards, or other such work."
  religion: "Thaellegoth rarely worship any deity. However, if pressed for a specific loyalty, most will choose Randar Delaco as their patron. The simple reason for this is due to his legendary brutality, something that appeals to the nature of the thaellegoth."
  language: "Thaellegoth speak Common almost exclusively. They will occasionally learn Orc, but share the Orc's distaste of nearly all things Elven. As such, thaellegoth rarely learn to speak the Elven language."
  names: "Thaellegoth typically take names that will help them fit in, as best they are able, with the rest of society. Their names are usually similar to human names, but there are also those who prefer to tout their Orc heritage. These thaellegoth often choose names common among Orc tribes."
