        Powerful Build: The physical stature of bugbears lets them function in many ways as if they were one size category larger.

        Whenever a bugbear is subject to a size modifier or special size modifier for an opposed check (such as during grapple checks, bull rush attempts, and trip attempts), the bugbear is treated as one size larger if doing so is advantageous to him.

        A bugbear is also considered to be one size larger when determining whether a creature's special attacks based on size (such as improved grab or swallow whole) can affect him. A bugbear can use weapons designed for a creature one size larger without penalty. However, his space and reach remain those of a creature of his actual size. The benefits of this racial trait stack with the effects of powers, abilities, and spells that change the subject's size category.
