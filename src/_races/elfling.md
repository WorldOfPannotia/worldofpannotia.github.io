  traits: |
     * +2 Dexterity, -2 Strength.
     * Small: As a Small creature, an elfling gains a +1 size bonus to Armor Class, a +1 size bonus on attack rolls, and a +4 size bonus on {% skill_link hide %} checks, but she uses smaller weapons than humans use, and her lifting and carrying limits are three-quarters of those of a Medium character.
     * Low-Light Vision: An elfling can see twice as far as a human in starlight, moonlight, torchlight, and similar conditions of poor illumination. She retains the ability to distinguish color and detail under these conditions.
     * Weapon Proficiency: Elflings receive the Martial/Simple Weapon Proficiency feats for the shortbow (including composite shortbow), sling, and thrown weapons as bonus feats.
     * Elfling base land speed is 30 feet.
     * An elfling receives a +2 racial bonus on {% skill_link listen %}, {% skill_link move-silently %}, and {% skill_link spot %} checks, but does not gain the elf ability to notice secret doors within 5 ft.
     * +1 racial bonus on all saving throws.
     * Mixed Blood: For all effects related to race, an elfling is considered both an elf and a halfling. However, in cases where these distinctions would conflict with one another, an elfling is considered to be the more beneficial race.
     * Automatic Languages: Common, Elven, and Halfling; Bonus Languages:  Draconic, Dwarven, Gnoll, Gnome, Goblin, Orc, and Sylvan.
     * Favored Class: Rogue. A multiclass elfling's rogue class does not count when determining whether she takes an experience point penalty for multiclassing.
