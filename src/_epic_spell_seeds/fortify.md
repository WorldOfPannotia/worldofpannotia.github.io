    Spells using the fortify seed grant a +1 enhancement bonus to whichever one of the following the caster chooses:

     * Any one ability score.
     * Any one kind of saving throw.
     * Spell resistance.
     * Natural armor.

    The fortify seed can also grant energy resistance 1 for one energy type or 1 temporary hit point. For each additional +1 bonus, point of energy resistance, or hit point, increase the Spellcraft DC by +2.

    The fortify seed has a base Spellcraft DC of 23 if it grants a +1 bonus of a type other than enhancement. For each additional +1 bonus of a type other than enhancement, increase the Spellcraft DC by +6. If the caster applies a factor to make the duration permanent, the bonus must be an inherent bonus, and the maximum inherent bonus allowed is +5.

    The fortify seed has a base Spellcraft DC of 27 if it grants a creature a +1 bonus to an ability score or other statistic it does not possess. For each additional +1 bonus, increase the Spellcraft DC by +4. If a spell with the fortify seed grants an inanimate object an ability score it would not normally possess (such as Intelligence), the spell must also incorporate the life seed.

    Granting spell resistance to a creature that doesn't already have it is a special case; the base Spellcraft DC of 27 grants spell resistance 25, and each additional point of spell resistance increases the Spellcraft DC by +4 (each –1 to spell resistance reduces the Spellcraft DC by –2).

    The fortify seed can also grant damage reduction 1/magic. For each additional point of damage reduction, increase the Spellcraft DC by +2. To increase the damage reduction value to epic, increase the Spellcraft DC by +15.

    A special use of the fortify seed grants the target a permanent +1 year to its current age category. For each additional +1 year added to the creature's current age category, increase the Spellcraft DC by +2. Incremental adjustments to a creature's maximum age do not stack; they overlap. When a spell increases a creature's current age category, all higher age categories are also adjusted accordingly.
