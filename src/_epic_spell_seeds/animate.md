  description:        |
    This seed can imbue inanimate objects with mobility and a semblance of life (not actual life). The animated object attacks whomever or whatever the caster initially designates. The animated object can be of any nonmagical material. The caster can also animate part of a larger mass of raw matter, such as a volume of water in the ocean, part of a stony wall, or the earth itself, as long as the volume of material does not exceed 20 cubic feet. For each additional 10 cubic feet of matter animated, increase the Spellcraft DC by +1, up to 1,000 cubic feet. For each additional 100 cubic feet of matter animated after the first 1,000 cubic feet, increase the spellcraft DC by +1. For each additional Hit Die granted to an animated object of a given size, increase the Spellcraft DC by +2. To animate attended objects (objects carried or worn by another creature), increase the Spellcraft DC by +10.
