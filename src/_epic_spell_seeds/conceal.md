  description:        |
    This seed can conceal a creature or object touched from sight, even from darkvision. If the subject is a creature carrying gear, the gear vanishes too, rendering the creature invisible. A spell using the conceal seed ends if the subject attacks any creature. Actions directed at unattended objects do not break the spell, and causing harm indirectly is not an attack. To create invisibility that lasts regardless of the actions of the subject, increase the Spellcraft DC by +4. Alternatively, this seed can conceal the exact location of the subject so that it appears to be about 2 feet away from its true location; this increases the Spellcraft DC by +2. The subject benefits from a 50% miss chance as if it had total concealment. However, unlike actual total concealment, this displacement effect does not prevent enemies from targeting him or her normally. The conceal seed can also be used to block divination spells, spell-like effects, and epic spells developed using the reveal seed; this increases the Spellcraft DC by +6. In all cases where divination magic of any level, including epic level, is employed against the subject of a spell using the conceal seed for this purpose, an opposed caster level check determines which spell works.
