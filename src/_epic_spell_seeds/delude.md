  description:        |
    A spell developed with the delude seed creates the visual illusion of an object, creature, or force, as visualized by the caster. The caster can move the image within the limits of the size of the effect by concentrating (the image is otherwise stationary). The image disappears when struck by an opponent unless the caster causes the illusion to react appropriately. For an illusion that includes audible, olfactory, tactile, taste, and thermal aspects, increase the Spellcraft DC by +2 per extra aspect. Even realistic tactile and thermal illusions can't deal damage, however. For each additional image to be created, increase the Spellcraft DC by +1. For an illusion that follows a script determined by the caster, increase the Spellcraft DC by +9. The figment follows the script without the caster having to concentrate on it. The illusion can include intelligible speech if desired. For an illusion that makes any area appear to be something other than it is, increase the Spellcraft DC by +4. Additional components, such as sounds, can be added as noted above. Concealing creatures requires additional spell development using this or other seeds.
