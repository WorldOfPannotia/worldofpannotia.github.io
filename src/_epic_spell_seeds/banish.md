    This seed forces extraplanar creatures out of the caster's home plane. The caster can banish up to 14 HD of extraplanar creatures. For each additional 2 HD of extraplanar creatures banished, increase the Spellcraft DC by +1. To specify a type or sub-type of creature other than outsider to be banished, increase the Spellcraft DC by +20.
