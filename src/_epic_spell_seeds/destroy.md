  description:        |
    This seed deals 20d6 points of damage to the target. The damage is of no particular type or energy. For each additional 1d6 points of damage dealt, increase the Spellcraft DC by +2. If the target is reduced to â€“10 hit points or less (or a construct, object, or undead is reduced to 0 hit points), it is utterly destroyed as if disintegrated, leaving behind only a trace of fine dust. Up to a 10-foot cube of nonliving matter is affected, so a spell using the destroy seed destroys only part of any very large object or structure targeted. The destroy seed affects even magical matter, energy fields, and force effects that are normally only affected by the disintegrate spell. Such effects are automatically destroyed. Epic spells using the ward seed may also be destroyed, though the caster must succeed at an opposed caster level check against the other spellcaster to bring down a ward spell.
