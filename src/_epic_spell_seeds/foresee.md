    The caster can foretell the immediate future, or gain information about specific questions. He or she is 90% likely to receive a meaningful reading of the future of the next 30 minutes. If successful, the caster knows if a particular action will bring good results, bad results, or no result. For each additional 30 minutes into the future, multiply the Spellcraft DC by x2. For better results, the caster can pose up to ten specific questions (one per round while he or she concentrates) to unknown powers of other planes, but the base Spellcraft DC for such an attempt is 23.  The answers return in a language the caster understands, but use only one-word replies: “yes,” “no,” “maybe,” “never,” “irrelevant,” or some other one-word answer. Unlike 0- to 9th-level spells of similar type, all questions answered are 90% likely to be answered truthfully. However, a specific spell using the foresee seed can only be cast once every five weeks. The foresee seed is also useful for epic spells requiring specific information before functioning, such as spells using the reveal and transport seeds. The foresee seed can also be used to gain one basic piece of information about a living target: level, class, alignment, or some special ability (or one of an object's magical abilities, if any). For each additional piece of information revealed, increase the Spellcraft DC by +2.
