<h4>Creating An Awakened Construct</h4>

"Awakened Construct" is an acquired template that can be added to any construct (referred to hereafter as the base creature).

An awakened construct uses all the base creature's statistics and special abilities except as noted here.

**Size and Type:** The creature's type remains construct, and it gains the augmented subtype. Do not recalculate base attack bonus, saves, or skill points. Size is unchanged.

**Hit Dice:** Same as the base creature.

**Speed:** Same as the base creature.

**Armor Class:** Same as the base creature.

**Attacks:** Same as the base creature. An awakened construct may use manufactured weapons in addition to or in place of its regular attacks, due to its aquired proficiencies.

**Damage:** Same as the base creature or as appropriate for manufactured weapons the awakened construct may choose to use.

**Special Attacks:** Same as the base creature.

**Special Qualities:** An awakened construct retains all the special qualities of the base creature and also gains the following.

_Sentience (Ex):_ An awakened construct loses its immunity to all mind-affecting effects (charms, compulsions, phantasms, patterns, and morale effects).

_Healing (Ex):_ Awakened constructs heal damage at half the rate of normal living creatures. In addition, normal healing spells (cure spells, heal, etc) work on an awakened construct, though they only cure half as many hit points as normal. Likewise, inflict spells work on an awakened construct, dealing half as much damage as normal.

_[Clay/Flesh/Metal/Stone] Body (Ex):_ Awakened constructs made from clay are affected by spells such as transmute mud to rock. Those made from flesh are subject to spells such as transmute flesh to stone. Awakened constructs made from metal take double damage from heat metal / chill metal as though wearing metal armor. Awakened constructs made from stone are vulnerable to spells such as transmute stone to flesh or transmute rock to mud. In any of these cases, the awakened construct gains a +8 racial bonus on their save.

**Saves:** An awakened construct gains a +8 racial bonus to saves vs mind-affecting effects. It can choose to suppress this ability at will.

**Abilities:** An awakened construct gains base Intelligence and Charisma scores of 10, modified as follows based on the construct's materials.

 * Clay Golem - Int +2, Cha +2
 * Flesh Golem - Int -2, Cha +2
 * Iron Golem - Int +0, Cha +6
