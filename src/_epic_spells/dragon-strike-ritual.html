  description: |
    This spell summons ten adult red dragons. They appear where the character designates and act immediately. They attack the character's opponents to the best of their abilities (on the first round, they all prefer to simultaneously breathe fire on an enemy, if possible). The character can direct the dragons not to attack, to attack particular enemies, or to perform other actions.
