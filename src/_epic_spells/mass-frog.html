  description: |
    This epic spell turns all Medium or smaller creatures in the area into frogs. The transformed creatures retain their mental faculties, including personality, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, level and class, hit points (despite any change in Consitution score), alignment, base attack bonus, base save bonuses, extraordinary abilities, spells, and spell-like abilities, but not supernatural abilities. They assume the physical characteristics of frogs, including natural size and Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores. (Use the statistics for the toad.) All the creatures' equipment drops to the ground upon transformation.
