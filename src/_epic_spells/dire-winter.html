  description: |
    The creature or object targeted emanates bitter cold to a radius of 1,000 feet for 20 hours. The emanated cold deals {% die_roll 2 6 0 %} points of damage per round against unprotected creatures (the target is susceptible if not magically protected or otherwise resistant to the energy). The intense cold freezes water out of the air, causing constant snowfall and wind. The snow and wind produce a blizzard effect within the area.
