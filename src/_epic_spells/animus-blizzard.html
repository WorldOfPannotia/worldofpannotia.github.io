  description: |
    When this spell is cast, enemies within range are dealt {% die_roll 30 6 0 %} points of cold damage. However, up to five victims that perish as a result of this blast are then instantly animated as wights. These five wights serve the character indefinitely. The character cannot exceed the normal limit for controlling undead through use of this spell, but other means that allow the character to exceed the normal limit for controlled undead work just as well with undead created with animus blizzard.
