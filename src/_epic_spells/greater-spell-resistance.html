  description: |
    The character grants the subject touched spell resistance 35 until the duration expires. The spell resistance granted does not stack, but overlaps with, any previous spell resistance. This is a ritual spell, requiring two other spellcasters, each of whom must contribute an unused 6th-level spell slot to the casting.
