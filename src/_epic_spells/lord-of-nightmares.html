  description: |
    The character is possessed by a dream larva. For 20 rounds, the dream larva's body physically replaces the character's, though the dream larva has the character's equipment. The dream larva is free to call on all its own powers and abilities, or use the character's equipment. The character's consciousness and physical form are suppressed for the duration of the possession. The character has no way to dismiss the spell, communicate, or otherwise maintain awareness once possession has commenced. The dream larva, temporarily freed from its imprisonment in some distant nightmare, will attempt to slay and incapacitate any creature it can see or find, whether it is a friend or foe of the caster. Casting lord of nightmares entails some risk for the caster, since it's unknown what a dream larva might do over the course of 20 rounds. The larva will dispatch all enemies it can find before turning to its own concerns. Sometimes a dream larva will attempt to place itself in a dangerous or precarious situation prior to the end of the spell, leaving the caster to extricate him or herself. If the dream larva is slain during the duration of the spell, the character's consciousness is instantly restored to aware-ness within his or her own body. The character's condition remains what it was when he or she completed casting lord of nightmares, regardless of what damage the dream larva received. However, magic item charges used, potions consumed, and other physical resources used up by the dream larva are permanent.
