  description: |
    In the hands of any character other than a paladin, this sword performs as a _+3 holy longsword_. In the hands of a paladin, this weapon functions as a _+7 longsword of holy power_ and grants a +5 sacred bonus on the wielder's saving throws against spells with the evil descriptor or spells cast by evil characters. If the paladin wielder smites evil with the _holy devastator_, he or she adds twice his or her paladin level to damage (rather than his or her paladin level).
