  description: |
    In the hands of any character other than a blackguard, this sword performs as a _+3 unholy longsword_. In the hands of a blackguard, this weapon functions as a _+7 longsword of unholy power_ and grants a +5 profane bonus on the wielder's saving throws against spells with the good descriptor or spells cast by good characters. If a blackguard wielder smites good with the _unholy despoiler_, he or she adds twice his or her blackguard level to damage (rather than his or her blackguard level).
