  description: |
    In the hands of any nonelf, this bow performs only as a _+2 composite longbow_. In the hands of an elf, this weapon functions as a _+5 composite longbow of unerring accuracy_ with a Strength bonus that matches its elven wielder's current Strength at all times. Furthermore, any arrows loosed from the bow are considered keen, regardless of the enhancement bonus of the arrow fired.
