<p id="gripsoul">**Gripsoul:** _Gripsoul_ is a _+6 keen long-sword_, but instead of dealing additional damage on a critical hit, the weapon imprisons the victim in a gem set in the pommel of the sword as per a _binding_ spell heightened to 16th level (DC 30). The same is true of any blow that would otherwise kill a foe or knock him or her unconscious. Only one creature can be so held, but the wielder can release the bound soul at any time with a command word.
_binding_; _Market Price:_ 1,856,500 gp; _Cost to Create:_ 934,500 gp + 28,440 XP.
