  description: |
    Both ends of this _+5 quarterstaff of speed_ have equal enhancement and special powers, meaning that it allows an additional attack with each end every round. While the _quarterstaff of alacrity_ is held, it grants its wielder a +5 resistance bonus on Reflex saves. It also deflects ranged weapons as if the wielder had the {% feat_link deflect-arrows %} and {% epic_feat_link infinite-deflection %} feats.
