<p id="quarterstaff-of-alacrity">**Quarterstaff of Alacrity:** Both ends of this _+5 quarterstaff of speed_ have equal enhancement and special powers, meaning that it allows an additional attack with each end every round. While the _quarterstaff of alacrity_ is held, it grants its wielder a +5 resistance bonus on Reflex saves. It also deflects ranged weapons as if the wielder had the Deflect Arrows and Infinite Deflection feats.
{% spell_link protection-from-arrows %}, {% spell_link shield %}; _Market Price:_ 462,600 gp; _Cost to Create:_ 231,600 gp + 14,620 XP.
