    This _+6 greataxe of anarchic power_ grants its wielder the ability to fly into a rage (identical to a barbarian's rage) once per day (or one additional time per day if the wielder already has the rage class feature). If the wielder has the greater rage class feature, the weapon also grants the wielder the {% epic_feat_link incite-rage %} epic feat.
