  description: |
    This rod is indistinguishable from a _+1 light mace_. It has eight flanges on its macelike head. The rod bestows a +1 insight bonus on initiative checks. If grasped firmly, the rod enables the holder to use {% spell_link detect-evil %}, {% spell_link detect-good %}, {% spell_link detect-chaos %}, {% spell_link detect-law %}, {% spell_link detect-magic %}, {% spell_link discern-lies %}, {% spell_link light %}, or {% spell_link see-invisibility %}. Each different use is a standard action.

    If the head of a _rod of alertness_ is planted in the ground, and the possessor wills it to alertness (a standard action), the rod senses any creature within 120 feet who intends to harm the possessor. At the same time, the rod creates the effect of a {% spell_link prayer %} spell upon all creatures friendly to the possessor in a 20-foot radius. Immediately thereafter, the rod sends forth a mental alert to these friendly creatures, warning them of possible danger from the unfriendly creature or creatures within the 120-foot radius. These effects last for 10 minutes, and the rod can perform this function once per day. Last, the rod can be used to simulate the casting of an {% spell_link animate-objects %} spell, utilizing any eleven (or fewer) Small objects located roughly around the perimeter of a 5-foot-radius circle centered on the rod when planted in the ground. Objects remain animated for 11 rounds. The rod can perform this function once per day.
