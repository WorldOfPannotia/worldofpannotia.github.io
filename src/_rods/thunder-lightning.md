    Constructed of iron set with silver rivets, this rod has the properties of a _+2 light mace_. Its other magical powers are as follows.

    <li>_Thunder:_ Once per day, the rod can strike as a _+3 light mace_, and the opponent struck is stunned from the noise of the rod's impact (Fortitude DC 16 negates). Activating this power counts as a free action, and it works if the wielder strikes an opponent within 1 round.</li>
    <li>_Lightning:_ Once per day, when the wielder desires, a short spark of electricity can leap forth when the rod strikes an opponent to deal the normal damage for a _+2 light mace_ (1d6+2) and an extra 2d6 points of electricity damage. Even when the rod might not score a normal hit in combat, if the roll was good enough to count as a successful melee touch attack hit, then the 2d6 points of electricity damage still applies. The wielder activates this power as a free action, and it works if he strikes an opponent within 1 round.</li>
    <li>_Thunderclap:_ Once per day as a standard action, the wielder can cause the rod to give out a deafening noise, just as a {% spell_link shout %} spell (Fortitude DC 16 partial, 2d6 points of sonic damage, target deafened for 2d6 rounds).</li>
    <li>_Lightning Stroke:_ Once per day as a standard action, the wielder can cause the rod to shoot out a 5-foot-wide lightning bolt (9d6 points of electricity damage, Reflex DC 16 half ) to a range of 200 feet.</li>
    <li>_Thunder and Lightning:_ Once per week as a standard action, the wielder of the rod can combine the _thunderclap_ described above with a lightning bolt, as in the _lightning stroke_. The thunderclap affects all within 10 feet of the bolt. The _lightning stroke_ deals 9d6 points of electricity damage (count rolls of 1 or 2 as rolls of 3, for a range of 27 to 54 points), and the _thunderclap_ deals 2d6 points of sonic damage. A single DC 16 Reflex save applies for both effects.</li>
