  description: |
    This long slender rod has seven vials surrounding a large ruby at the top. Each of these vials may be filled with a potion. As a stanard action, the wielder may make a ranged touch attack (as with a ray) at any target within 30 ft. If the attack roll succeeds, the target is affected by one of the potions in the vials, and the potion is considered used. The wielder must choose the potion to be used before making the attack roll.
