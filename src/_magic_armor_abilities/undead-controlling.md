The wearer of a suit of armor or a shield with this property may control up to 26 HD of undead per day, as the _control undead_ spell. At dawn each day, the wearer loses control of any undead still under his sway. Armor or a shield with this ability appears to be made of bone; this feature is entirely decorative and has no other effect on the armor.
