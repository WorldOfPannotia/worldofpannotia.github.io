  description: |
    A suit of armor with this ability appears normal. Upon command, the armor changes shape and form to assume the appearance of a normal set of clothing. The armor retains all its properties (including weight) when glamered. Only a {% spell_link true-seeing %} spell or similar magic reveals the true nature of the armor when disguised.
