A suit of armor with this ability appears normal. Upon command, the armor changes shape and form to assume the appearance of a normal set of clothing. The armor retains all its properties (including weight) when glamered. Only a _true seeing_ spell or similar magic reveals the true nature of the armor when disguised.
