The wearer of this ring is constantly sheathed in an _unholy aura_ effect. It bestows one negative level on any good creature that puts it on. The negative level remains as long as the ring is worn and disappears when the ring is removed. This negative level never results in actual level loss, but it cannot be overcome in any way (including _restoration_ spells) while the ring is worn.
Forge Ring, Forge Epic Ring, _unholy aura_, creator must be evil; _Market Price:_ 250,000 gp.
