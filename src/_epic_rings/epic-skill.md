  description: |
    Rings of this nature continually grant the wearer a +100 competence bonus on checks relating to the skill the ring is tied to. For example, a _Ring of Epic Spellcraft_ would grant a +100 bonus to the {% skill_link spellcraft %} skill, allowing an epic spellcaster to develop and cast powerful epic spells.
