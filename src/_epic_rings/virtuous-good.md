  description: |
    The wearer of this ring is constantly sheathed in a {% spell_link holy-aura %} effect. It bestows one negative level on any evil creature that puts it on. The negative level remains as long as the ring is worn and disappears when the ring is removed. This negative level never results in actual level loss, but it cannot be over-come in any way (including {% spell_link restoration %} spells) while the ring is worn.
