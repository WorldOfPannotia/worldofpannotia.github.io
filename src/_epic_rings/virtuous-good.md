The wearer of this ring is constantly sheathed in a _holy aura_ effect. It bestows one negative level on any evil creature that puts it on. The negative level remains as long as the ring is worn and disappears when the ring is removed. This negative level never results in actual level loss, but it cannot be over-come in any way (including _restoration_ spells) while the ring is worn.
Forge Ring, Forge Epic Ring, _holy aura_, creator must be good; _Market Price:_ 250,000 gp; _Cost to Create:_ 125,000 gp + 12,500 XP.
