The wearer of this ring is constantly sheathed in a _cloak of chaos_ effect. It bestows one negative level on any lawful creature that puts it on. The negative level remains as long as the ring is worn and disappears when the ring is removed. This negative level never results in actual level loss, but it cannot be overcome in any way (including _restoration_ spells) while the ring is worn.
Forge Ring, Forge Epic Ring, _cloak of chaos_, creator must be chaotic; _Market Price:_ 250,000 gp.
