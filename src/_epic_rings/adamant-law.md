The wearer of this ring is constantly sheathed in a _shield of law_ effect. It bestows one negative level on any chaotic creature that puts it on. The negative level remains as long as the ring is worn and disappears when the ring is removed. This negative level never results in actual level loss, but it cannot be overcome in any way (including _restoration_ spells) while the ring is worn.
Forge Ring, Forge Epic Ring, _shield of law_, creator must be lawful; _Market Price:_ 250,000 gp.
