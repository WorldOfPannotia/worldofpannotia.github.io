  description: |
    The wearer of this ring is constantly sheathed in a {% spell_link shield-of-law %} effect. It bestows one negative level on any chaotic creature that puts it on. The negative level remains as long as the ring is worn and disappears when the ring is removed. This negative level never results in actual level loss, but it cannot be overcome in any way (including {% spell_link restoration %} spells) while the ring is worn.
