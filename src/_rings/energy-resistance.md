  description: |
    This reddish iron ring continually protects the wearer from damage from one type of energy &ndash; acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic (chosen by the creator of the item; determine randomly if found as part of a treasure hoard). Each time the wearer would normally take such damage, subtract the ring's resistance value from the damage dealt.

    A _minor ring of energy resistance_ grants 10 points of resistance. A _major ring of energy resistance_ grants 20 points of resistance. A _greater ring of energy resistance_ grants 30 points of resistance.
