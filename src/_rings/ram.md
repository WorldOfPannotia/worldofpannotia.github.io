  description: |
    The _ring of the ram_ is an ornate ring forged of hard metal, usually iron or an iron alloy. It has the head of a ram as its device.

    The wearer can command the ring to give forth a ramlike force, manifested by a vaguely discernible shape that resembles the head of a ram or a goat. This force strikes a single target, dealing {% die_roll 1 6 0 %} points of damage if 1 charge is expended, {% die_roll 2 6 0 %} points if 2 charges are used, or {% die_roll 3 6 0 %} points if 3 charges (the maximum) are used. Treat this as a ranged attack with a 50-foot maximum range and no penalties for distance.

    The force of the blow is considerable, and those struck by the ring are subject to a bull rush if within 30 feet of the ring-wearer. (The ram has Strength 25 and is Large.) The ram gains a +1 bonus on the bull rush attempt if 2 charges are expended, or +2 if 3 charges are expended.

    In addition to its attack mode, the _ring of the ram_ also has the power to open doors as if it were a character with Strength 25. If 2 charges are expended, the effect is equivalent to a character with Strength 27. If 3 charges are expended, the effect is that of a character with Strength 29.

    A newly created ring has 50 charges. When all the charges are expended, the ring becomes a nonmagical item.
