  description: |
    This special ring comes in four kinds (_ring of wizardry I_, _ring of wizardry II_, _ring of wizardry III_, and _ring of wizardry IV_), all of them useful only to arcane spellcasters. The wearer's arcane spells per day are doubled for one specific spell level. A _ring of wizardry I_ doubles 1st-level spells, a _ring of wizardry II_ doubles 2nd-level spells, a _ring of wizardry III_ doubles 3rd-level spells, and a _ring of wizardry IV_ doubles 4th-level spells. Bonus spells from high ability scores or school specialization are not doubled.
