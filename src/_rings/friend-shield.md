  description: |
    These curious rings always come in pairs. A _friend shield_ ring without its mate is useless. Either wearer of one of a pair of the rings can, at any time, command his or her ring to cast a {% spell_link shield-other %} spell with the wearer of the mated ring as the recipient. This effect has no range limitation.
