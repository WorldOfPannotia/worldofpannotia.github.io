title: "Clearsight"

ability:
  prerequisite: |
    Divine rank 6, Wis 29.
  benefit: |
    The deity can see illusions, transmuted creatures and objects, and disguised creatures or objects for what they really are, provided they are within 10 feet per divine rank of the deity. This ability is similar to the _true seeing_ spell, except that it does not reveal creatures' alignments and it does foil mundane disguises.
  portfolioElements: |
    Knowledge, truth.
