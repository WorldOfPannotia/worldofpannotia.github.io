title: "Command Plants"

ability:
  benefit: |
    The deity can make plants grow in a radius of up to one mile per divine rank once per day. The deity can use this ability even in a place where no plants grow, though in this case the plants wither and die after one day. This ability works like the {% spell_link plant-growth %} spell, except that it cannot be countered except by a deity of higher rank than the deity using the ability.

    Also once per day, the deity can charm plant creatures, animate plants, or make them entangle its foes. This ability functions like the {% spell_link command-plants %} spell, except that its maximum duration is one day no matter which option the deity chooses. At any one time, the deity can charm a number of plant creatures equal to its divine rank with this ability, regardless of Hit Dice.
