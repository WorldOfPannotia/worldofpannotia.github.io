title: "Wound Enemy"

ability:
  prerequisite: |
    Base attack bonus +20.
  benefit: |
    The affected weapon deals damage to a creature such that a wound it causes deals 1d6 points of damage per round thereafter in addition to the normal damage from the weapon. Multiple wounds from the weapon result in cumulative bleeding loss (two wounds for 2d6 points of damage per round, and so on). The bleeding can only be stopped by a successful _heal_ check (DC 15 + the deity's rank) or the application of any _cure_ spell or other healing spell _(heal, healing circle,_ and so on).
  notes: |
    The ability functions only when the deity personally attacks with a physical weapon. The ability works with a ranged weapon, but not if someone else uses the weapon. The deity can apply to the ability to any weapon or natural weapon, but not to a spell, spell-like ability, supernatural ability, or divine ability. A deity can have this ability multiple times, and its effects stack.
  portfolioElements: |
    Death, pain, war.
