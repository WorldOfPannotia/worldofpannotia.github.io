title: "Divine Glibness"

ability:
  prerequisite: |
    Cha 29, _bluff_ 40 ranks, Trickery domain.
  benefit: |
    As a full-round action, the deity can speak and convince others to take some course of action. This works like a _mass suggestion_ spell cast at a level equal to 10 + the deity's divine rank, except that it affects up to (10 + divine rank) creatures, no two of which can be more than (10 &times; divine rank) feet apart. The save DC is 10 + the deity's Charisma modifier + the deity's divine rank.
  portfolioElements: |
    Commerce, lies, thieves.
