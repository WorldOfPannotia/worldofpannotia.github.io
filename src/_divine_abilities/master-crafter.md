ability:
  prerequisite: |
    23 ranks in two different _craft_ skills.
  benefit: |
    Any object the deity creates is treated as a masterwork item, but uses the base item price (not the masterwork price) to determine time and cost required to create it. Any item the deity creates also has twice the hit points it would normally have, and its break DC is increased by +10. These benefits apply to walls, doors, and other components of buildings the deity creates, as well as smaller items.
