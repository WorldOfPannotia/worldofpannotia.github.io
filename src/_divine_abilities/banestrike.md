    The ability functions only when the deity personally attacks with a melee weapon or ranged weapon. The deity can apply the Banestrike ability to any weapon or natural weapon, but not to a spell, spell-like ability, supernatural ability, or divine ability.

    A deity can have this ability multiple times, choosing a different kind of foe each time. The deity can imbue only one bane special ability to a weapon at a time and can change among them once a round as a free action.
