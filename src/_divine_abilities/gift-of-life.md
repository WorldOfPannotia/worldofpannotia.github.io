title: "Gift of Life"

ability:
  benefit: |
    The deity restores the dead creature to life, no matter how long the creature has been dead or what the condition of the body.
  notes: |
    This ability works like the _true resurrection_ spell, except that there is no material component and the amount of time the subject has been dead is irrelevant.

    This ability can restore a creature to life against its will, but only with the permission of whatever deity rules the underworld or the divine realm where the mortal's soul resides. This ability can resurrect an elemental or outsider and can resurrect a creature whose soul is trapped, provided the soul is not held by a deity of higher rank than the one using this ability.

    This ability cannot restore life to a creature that has been slain by the Hand of Death ability or the Life and Death ability of a deity with a higher rank.

    Healing, life.
