title: "Lay Curse"

ability:
  benefit: |
    This ability works like the {% spell_link bestow-curse %} spell, except that mortals get no save. Deities of equal or lesser rank are subject to this ability, but are allowed Will saves (DC 10 + the deity's Charisma modifier + the deity's divine rank) to resist. The curse can be removed only by a deity of equal or higher rank than the cursing deity.

    The deity can affect up to one creature per divine rank at once, but no more than that number each day. All must be within the deity's line of sight when first affected.
