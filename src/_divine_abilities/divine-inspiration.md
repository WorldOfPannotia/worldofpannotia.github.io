  benefit: |
    The deity can enchant creatures to create a specific emotion. The deity can affect one creature per divine rank at once, and up to the same number each day. All must be within the deity's line of sight when first affected. The specific effects depend on the emotional state induced.

    _Courage:_ The enchanted creatures become immune to fear effects and receive a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, skill checks, and Will saves.

    _Despair:_ The enchanted creatures are affected as by an improved version of the {% spell_link crushing-despair %} spell: affected creatures suffer a -4 penalty on attack rolls, damage rolls, saves, and checks unless they make a successful Will save (DC 10 + deity's Charisma modifier + deity's divine rank). The effect lasts one day.

    _Dread:_ The enchanted creatures must make successful Wisdom checks (DC = the deity's divine rank) to attack or fight. If the check fails, the creature flees in panic for 1d4 rounds. If the check succeeds, the creature does not have to check again for 10 minutes. The enchanted creatures also suffer a -2 morale penalty on attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, skill checks, and Will saves.

    _Frenzy:_ Frenzied creatures spend themselves in drinking, feasting, and dancing unless provoked or incited to violence. Frenzied creatures turn violent if they are attacked or perceive a threat to their safety. Frenzied creatures receive a +4 morale bonus to Strength and Dexterity, a -4 penalty to Wisdom, and a -2 penalty to AC. Subjects can attempt Will saves (DC 10 + deity's Charisma modifier + deity's divine rank) to resist the effect. This is a mind-affecting compulsion.

    _Hope:_ The enchanted creatures gain a +4 morale bonus on saving throws, attack rolls, ability checks, skill checks, and weapon damage rolls.

    _Rage:_ The enchanted creatures receive a +4 morale bonus to Strength and Constitution scores, a +2 morale bonus on Will saves, and a -2 penalty to AC. They are compelled to fight heedless of danger. Subjects can attempt Will saves (DC 10 + deity's Charisma modifier + deity's divine rank) to resist the effect. This is a mind-affecting compulsion.

    _Love and Desire:_ A love effect causes the target to fall in love with the specified creature, seeking every opportunity to be near that creature and making every effort to win the creature's affection. A desire effect is similar, but the target seeks any opportunity to become physically intimate with the specified creature. Subjects can attempt Will saves (DC 10 + deity's Charisma modifier + deity's divine rank) to resist the effect. This is a mind-affecting compulsion effect.
