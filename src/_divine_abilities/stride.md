ability:
  prerequisite: |
    Travel domain.
  benefit: |
    The deity's movement is doubled on the local or overland scales. Also, having this ability means that the deity's height does not limit the distance it can jump.

    In addition, the deity can impart extra overland speed to living creatures. The deity can affect up to one creature per divine rank at once, but no more than that number each day. All must be within the deity's line of sight when first affected. Creatures who receive this boon double their speeds on the local or overland scales.
