title: "Power of Luck"

ability:
  prerequisite: |
    Luck domain.
  benefit: |
    The deity can give creatures good or bad fortune. The deity can affect up to one creature per divine rank at once, but no more than that number each day. All must be within the deity's line of sight when first affected. Subjects receive a luck bonus of +1 per divine rank or a luck penalty of -1 per divine rank on attack rolls, saves, and checks for one day. Any creature that attacks the deity automatically suffers the luck penalty, and this does not count against the deity's daily uses of this ability.
  portfolioElements: |
    Fate, gambling, luck.
