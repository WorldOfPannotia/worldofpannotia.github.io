title: "Hand of Death"

ability:
  benefit: |
    The deity points to any mortal within the deity's sensory range and snuffs out its life. There must be an unbroken line of effect between the deity and the target.
  notes: |
    This ability works like the _destruction_ spell, except that there is no material component. The mortal is allowed a Fortitude saving throw with a DC of 20 + the deity's Charisma bonus + the deity's divine rank. Even if the save succeeds, the subject takes 10d6 points of damage, which may kill it anyway. If the attack kills the mortal (either through a failed saving throw or through damage), the mortal cannot be raised or resurrected afterward, except by a deity of equal or higher rank using the Gift of Life, Life and Death, or Mass Life and Death salient divine ability.
