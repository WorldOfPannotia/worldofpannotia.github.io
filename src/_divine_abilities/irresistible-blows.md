title: "Irresistible Blows"

ability:
  prerequisite: |
    Weapon Focus and Improved Critical with the selected melee weapon.
  benefit: |
    When the deity makes a melee attack with the chosen weapon against a creature, resolve the attack as a melee touch attack (the weapon blow ignores armor and natural armor bonuses). If the weapon hits, the creature struck must make a Fortitude save (DC 10 + the deity's Constitution modifier + the deity's divine rank) or be stunned for 1d10 rounds.

    The deity's attacks with the chosen weapons are considered to be adamantine for purposes of bypassing damage reduction and hardness.
  notes: |
    A deity can have this ability multiple times, choosing a different kind of weapon each time.
  portfolioElements: |
    War.
