title: "Frightful Presence"

ability:
  prerequisite: |
    Cha 24.
  benefit: |
    Whenever the deity performs a specific action specified in the deity's description (usually attacking, but sometimes making an intimidating gesture), foes within a 30-foot-radius burst must make Will saves (DC 10 + deity's Charisma modifier + deity's divine rank). Foes within the burst, but not the deity's immediate target, become shaken for 3d6 rounds if they fail their saves. Creatures the deity attacks when it activates the ability become panicked for 3d6 rounds if they fail their saves. Foes who make successful saving throws are unaffected by this ability for one day.
  portfolioElements: |
    Destruction, war.
