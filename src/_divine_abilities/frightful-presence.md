title: "Frightful Presence"

ability:
  prerequisite: |
    Cha 24.
  benefit: |
    Whenever the deity performs a specific action specified in the deity's description (usually attacking, but sometimes making an intimidating gesture), foes within a 30-foot-radius burst must make Will saves (DC 10 + deity's Charisma modifier + deity's divine rank). Foes within the burst, but not the deity's immediate target, become shaken for {% die_roll 3 6 0 %} rounds if they fail their saves. Creatures the deity attacks when it activates the ability become panicked for {% die_roll 3 6 0 %} rounds if they fail their saves. Foes who make successful saving throws are unaffected by this ability for one day.
  portfolioElements: |
    Destruction, war.
