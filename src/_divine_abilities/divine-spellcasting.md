title: "Divine Spellcasting"

ability:
  prerequisite: |
    Spellcaster level 20th.
  benefit: |
    The deity can cast spells whose effective level is above 9th. The number of spells per day the deity can cast of each spell level above 9th depends on the deity's key ability score for spell-casting classes in which the deity has achieved 20th level, as shown on Table: Divine Spellcasting. The numbers on that table represent one spell per day at each spell level above 9th in which it receives bonus spells from its key ability score, plus bonus spells based on the key ability score. The deity can use these slots for spells prepared or cast with a metamagic feat, or for lower-level spells.

    If the deity has achieved 20th level in a spellcasting class with fewer than nine levels of spells (such as bard, paladin, or ranger), the deity can also cast one spell per day of each level between the maximum normal spell level and 9th, plus appropriate bonus spells of each level based on the deity's key ability score. These spells are not shown on the table.

    The deity also doesn't incur attacks of opportunity for casting spells when threatened.

    In addition, the deity receives the benefit of the Spell Focus feat on any spell it casts.

    ##### Spell Slots Above 9th Level

    The Divine Spellcasting ability grants deities access to spell slots above 9th level (which can be used to hold lower-level spells or spells whose level has been increased above 9th by the use of metamagic feats). The number of spell slots available to a deity depends on the deity's key ability score (Intelligence for wizards, Wisdom for clerics, druids, paladins, and rangers, and Charisma for bards and sorcerers), as shown on Table: Divine Spellcasting.

    Even though the table only includes ability scores up to 61 and spell slots up to 25th level, the progression continues infinitely in both directions. For ability scores beyond 61, or for spell slots above 25th level, expand the table to follow the same patterns as shown.

    The numbers on this table include bonus spells that a deity receives for having a sufficiently high ability score, as well as one additional spell of each level at which the deity gains at least one bonus spell. This additional spell is one of the benefits of the Divine Spellcasting salient divine ability.
