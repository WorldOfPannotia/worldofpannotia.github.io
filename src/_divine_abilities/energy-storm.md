title: "Energy Storm"

ability:
  prerequisite: |
    Divine rank 11.
  benefit: |
    The deity can surround itself with a vortex of energy (acid, cold, electricity, fire, sonic, positive, or negative energy, specified in the deity's description). The vortex extends from the deity in an emanation with a radius of 10 feet per divine rank. The effect stops attacks with thrown weapons and projectiles. Such attacks fail if made by creatures inside the area, or targeted at creatures within the area, or if their paths take them through the area.

    Energy storms that use acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic energy deal 1 point of energy damage and 1 point of holy damage per divine rank each round.

    Positive energy deals 1 point of damage per divine rank to undead creatures, and heals the same amount of damage on living creatures.

    Negative energy deals 1 point of negative energy per divine rank to living creatures, and heals the same amount of damage on undead creatures.
  notes: |
    A deity can have this ability multiple times, choosing a different type of energy each time.
  portfolioElements: |
    Fire, storms.
