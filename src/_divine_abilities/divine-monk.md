title: "Divine Monk"

ability:
  prerequisite: |
    Monk level 20th.
  benefit: |
    The deity's unarmed strikes are treated as a magic slashing weapon with an enhancement bonus of +5 and the keen, lawful, and vorpal qualities. If the deity chooses, a particular attack can be bludgeoning instead of slashing, but the keen and vorpal qualities do not apply to that attack. Any unarmed attack the deity makes has a base damage of 2d12.

    The deity can use the Deflect Arrows feat to deflect any ranged attacks (including spells that require ranged touch attacks) as if they were arrows. The deity can deflect any number of attacks in a single round. When the deity deflects any attack, the attack is reflected upon the attacker, using the deity's base ranged attack bonus. When the deity deflects a spell, the spell's level is added to the DC to deflect the attack. The deity only gains the second benefit of this ability if he or she has the Deflect Arrows feat.
