title: "Wave of Chaos"

ability:
  prerequisite: |
    Chaotic alignment.
  benefit: |
    The deity can create a wave of mental force that extends from the deity in a spread with a radius of 10 feet per divine rank. Creatures within the spread must make Will saves (DC 10 + the deity's Charisma modifier + the deity's divine rank) or be forced to act unpredictably. This ability works like a {% spell_link confusion %} spell cast by a sorcerer of level 10 + the deity's divine rank.
