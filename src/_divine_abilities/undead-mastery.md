  prerequisite: |
    Divine rank 14, Cleric level 17th.
  benefit: |
    The deity can automatically command or destroy any undead creature, as desired, as a free action, though this counts against the normal limit of free actions per round. The deity can do this as often as desired, but it can command no more than one undead creature per divine rank (regardless of the creatures' Hit Dice) at any one time.
  portfolioElements: |
    Death, life, undead.
