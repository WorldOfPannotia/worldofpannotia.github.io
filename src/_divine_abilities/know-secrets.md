title: "Know Secrets"

ability:
  description: |
    No secrets can be kept from the deity.
  benefit: |
    The deity can learn a creature's entire history (including any embarrassing or vital secrets it might know) just by looking at it. This ability is similar to the _legend lore_ spell, except that it delivers instant results and the subject is allowed a Will save (DC 10 + the deity's Charisma modifier + the deity's divine rank) to avoid the effect.
  portfolioElements: |
    Knowledge, secrets.
