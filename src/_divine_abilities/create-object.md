title: "Create Object"

ability:
  prerequisite: |
    Divine rank 6, Int 29.
  benefit: |
    As a full-round action, the deity can create one or more simple, nonmagical objects with a total weight of up to 50 pounds per divine rank, or with a total volume of 10 cubic feet per rank. If the deity uses this ability on a divinely morphic plane or within its own godly realm, double the volume and weight the deity can create. If the deity's realm is located on a divinely morphic plane, triple the volume and weight the deity can create there.
  notes: |
    For purposes of this ability, a simple object can have no moving parts more complex than a door hinge and must be composed of a single material. The material can be no more valuable than iron (1 sp per pound). Once created, the objects are permanent and nonmagical. If the deity has the appropriate _craft_ skill, the deity can make a _craft_ check when creating the item to make it a masterwork item.
