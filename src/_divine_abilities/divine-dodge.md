title: "Divine Dodge"

ability:
  prerequisite: |
    Dex 29.
  benefit: |
    Any physical attack or individually targeted spell directed at the deity has a percent miss chance equal to 50 + the deity's rank. Area effects that include the deity have a similar chance to be ineffective.
  notes: |
    The ability is similar to the _blink_ spell, except that it is defensive only and the deity does not move to the Ethereal Plane, but simply exits from reality for a brief moment. This ability never interferes with the deity's own attacks. If an attack overcomes the miss chance, the deity still gets the benefit of a saving throw (if one is allowed).
  portfolioElements: |
    Agility, gambling, luck, protection.
