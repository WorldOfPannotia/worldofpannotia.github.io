title: "Life Drain"

ability:
  prerequisite: |
    Death domain.
  benefit: |
    As a free action, the deity can generate a cloud of darkness that rises from its body in a spread with a radius of 10 feet per divine rank and 10 feet high. The cloud blocks sight as a _deeper darkness_ spell does, except that it cannot be countered by light effects (other than those cast by deities of higher rank). Living creatures must make Will saves (DC 10 + the deity's Charisma modifier + the deity's divine rank) or die. Even with a successful save, living creatures still gain two negative levels (the save DC to remove the negative levels is the same as the first Will save). A single creature can be drained by the cloud only once per day, but the cloud's darkness remains effective.
