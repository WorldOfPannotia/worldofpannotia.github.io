ability:
  prerequisite: |
    Good alignment, Sun domain.
  benefit: |
    The deity can shed light in a (10 feet &times; divine rank) emanation from its body. This light counters and dispels all darkness effects (unless created by a deity of higher rank) and causes pain and damage to undead creatures, who take 2d8 points of damage per round with no save. As a full attack action, the deity can generate up to three rays of scorching light that can strike targets up to a number of miles away equal to the deity's divine rank. Each ray deals 1d6 points of damage per 2 divine ranks. Undead take 1d12 points of damage per 2 divine ranks.
