title: "Instant Counterspell"

ability:
  benefit: |
    When any spell is cast within the deity's line of sight, the deity can counterspell it as a free action, provided that the deity is capable of casting the spell immediately or has it as a spell-like ability and makes the required {% skill_link spellcraft %} check. The use of Instant Counterspell counts against the normal number of free actions the deity is allowed each round.
