title: "Divine Rage"

ability:
  prerequisite: |
    Barbarian level 20th.
  benefit: |
    This ability is similar to the barbarian's rage ability (and it replaces the barbarian rage ability for the deity). The deity can activate this ability only after suffering damage from a weapon, and can use it a number of times per day equal to its divine rank. Once used, the ability lasts 1 hour (though the deity can end the rage at will). While raging, the deity gains +10 to Strength, +10 to Constitution, and a +5 morale bonus on Will saves. The deity's spell resistance and energy resistances each increase by +10. The deity also can make one extra attack, at its full attack bonus, whenever it uses the full attack action. While raging, the deity suffers a -5 penalty to Armor Class and cannot perform acts that require patience and concentration, such as moving silently, casting spells, and using salient divine abilities.
