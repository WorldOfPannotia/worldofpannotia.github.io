title: "Lay Quest"

ability:
  benefit: |
    This ability works like the {% spell_link geas/quest %} spell, except that it works only on mortals and it can be removed only by a deity of equal or higher rank than the deity who lays the quest. The deity can affect up to one creature per divine rank at once, but no more than that number each day. All must be within the deity's line of sight when first affected.
