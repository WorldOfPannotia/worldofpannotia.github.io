slug: "plant-defiance"

feat:
  name: "Plant Defiance"
  types: ["General"]
  prerequisite: |
    Ability to cast _detect animals or plants_.
  benefit: |
    You can turn (but not destroy) plant creatures as a good cleric turns undead. When determining the result of a turning attempt, treat all destruction results as normal turning. Treat immobile plant creatures as creatures unable to flee. This ability is usable a total number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier. You use your highest caster level to determine the level at which you turns plants.
