  name: "Reach Spell"
  types: ["Metamagic"]
  description: |
    You can cast spells with a readh of touch without actually touching the target.
  benefit: |
    You may cast a spell that normally has a range of touch at any distance up to 30 feet. The spell effectively becomes a ray, so you must succeed at a ranged touch attack to bestow the spell upon the recipient. A reach spell uses up a spell slot two levels higher than the spell's actual level.
