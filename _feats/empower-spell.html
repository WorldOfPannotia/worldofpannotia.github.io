  name: "Empower Spell"
  types: ["Metamagic"]
  benefit: |
    All variable, numeric effects of an empowered spell are increased by one-half.

    Saving throws and opposed rolls are not affected, nor are spells without random variables.

    An empowered spell uses up a spell slot two levels higher than the spell's actual level.
