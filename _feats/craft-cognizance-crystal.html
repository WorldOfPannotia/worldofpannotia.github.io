feat:
  name: "Craft Cognizance Crystal"
  types: ["Item Creation"]
  description: |
    You can create psionic _cognizance crystals_ that store power points.
  prerequisite: |
    Manifester level 3rd.
  benefit: |
    You can create a _cognizance crystal_. Doing so takes one day for each 1,000 gp in its base price. The base price of a _cognizance crystal_ is equal to the highest-level power it could manifest using all its stored power points, squared, multiplied by 1,000 gp. To create a _cognizance crystal_, you must spend 1/25 of its base price in XP and use up raw materials costing one-half its base price.
