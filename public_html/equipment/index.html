        <p>Assume a character owns at least one outfit of normal clothes. Pick any one of the following clothing outfits: artisan's outfit, entertainer's outfit, explorer's outfit, monk's outfit, peasant's outfit, scholar's outfit, or traveler's outfit.</p>
<h3>Wealth and Money Coins</h3>
<p>The most common coin is the gold piece (gp). A gold piece is worth 10 silver pieces. Each silver piece is worth 10 copper pieces (cp). In addition to copper, silver, and gold coins, there are also platinum pieces (pp), which are each worth 10 gp. The standard coin weighs about a third of an ounce (fifty to the pound).</p>

<h3>Wealth Other than Coins</h3>

<h3>Selling Loot</h3>
<p>In general, a character can sell something for half its listed price. Trade goods are the exception to the half-price rule. A trade good, in this sense, is a valuable good that can be easily exchanged almost as if it were cash itself.</p>

<p id="caltrops"><strong>Caltrops:</strong> A caltrop is a four-pronged iron spike crafted so that one prong faces up no matter how the caltrop comes to rest. You scatter caltrops on the ground in the hope that your enemies step on them or are at least forced to slow down to avoid them. One 2- pound bag of caltrops covers an area 5 feet square.</p>
<p>Each time a creature moves into an area covered by caltrops (or spends a round fighting while standing in such an area), it might step on one. The caltrops make an attack roll (base attack bonus +0) against the creature. For this attack, the creature's shield, armor, and deflection bonuses do not count. If the creature is wearing shoes or other footwear, it gets a +2 armor bonus to AC. If the caltrops succeed on the attack, the creature has stepped on one. The caltrop deals 1 point of damage, and the creature's speed is reduced by one-half because its foot is wounded. This movement penalty lasts for 24 hours, or until the creature is successfully treated with a DC 15 Heal check, or until it receives at least 1 point of magical curing. A charging or running creature must immediately stop if it steps on a caltrop. Any creature moving at half speed or slower can pick its way through a bed of caltrops with no trouble.</p>
<p>Caltrops may not be effective against unusual opponents.</p>
<p id="candle"><strong>Candle:</strong> A candle dimly illuminates a 5-foot radius and burns for 1 hour.</p>
<p id="chain"><strong>Chain:</strong> Chain has hardness 10 and 5 hit points. It can be burst with a DC 26 Strength check.</p>
<p id="crowbar"><strong>Crowbar:</strong> A crowbar it grants a +2 circumstance bonus on Strength checks made for such purposes. If used in combat, treat a crowbar as a one-handed improvised weapon that deals bludgeoning damage equal to that of a club of its size.</p>
<p id="flint-and-steel"><strong>Flint and Steel:</strong> Lighting a torch with flint and steel is a full-round action, and lighting any other fire with them takes at least that long.</p>
<p id="grappling-hook"><strong>Grappling Hook:</strong> Throwing a grappling hook successfully requires a <em>use rope</em> check (DC 10, +2 per 10 feet of distance thrown).</p>
<p id="hammer"><strong>Hammer:</strong> If a hammer is used in combat, treat it as a one-handed improvised weapon that deals bludgeoning damage equal to that of a spiked gauntlet of its size.</p>
<p id="ink"><strong>Ink:</strong> This is black ink. You can buy ink in other colors, but it costs twice as much.</p>
<p id="jug"><strong>Jug, Clay:</strong> This basic ceramic jug is fitted with a stopper and holds 1 gallon of liquid.</p>
<p id="lamp-common"><strong>Lamp, Common:</strong> A lamp clearly illuminates a 15-foot radius, provides shadowy illumination out to a 30-foot radius, and burns for 6 hours on a pint of oil. You can carry a lamp in one hand.</p>
<p id="lantern-bullseye"><strong>Lantern, Bullseye:</strong> A bullseye lantern provides clear illumination in a 60-foot cone and shadowy illumination in a 120-foot cone. It burns for 6 hours on a pint of oil. You can carry a bullseye lantern in one hand.</p>
<p id="lantern-hooded"><strong>Lantern, Hooded:</strong> A hooded lantern clearly illuminates a 30-foot radius and provides shadowy illumination in a 60-foot radius. It burns for 6 hours on a pint of oil. You can carry a hooded lantern in one hand.</p>
<p id="lock"><strong>Lock:</strong> The DC to open a lock with the <em>open lock</em> skill depends on the lock's quality: simple (DC 20), average (DC 25), good (DC 30), or superior (DC 40).</p>
<p id="manacles"><strong>Manacles and Manacles, Masterwork:</strong> Manacles can bind a Medium creature. A manacled creature can use the <em>escape artist</em> skill to slip free (DC 30, or DC 35 for masterwork manacles). Breaking the manacles requires a Strength check (DC 26, or DC 28 for masterwork manacles). Manacles have hardness 10 and 10 hit points.</p>
<p>Most manacles have locks; add the cost of the lock you want to the cost of the manacles.</p>
<p>For the same cost, you can buy manacles for a Small creature.</p>
<p>For a Large creature, manacles cost ten times the indicated amount, and for a Huge creature, one hundred times this amount. Gargantuan, Colossal, Tiny, Diminutive, and Fine creatures can be held only by specially made manacles.</p>
<p id="oil"><strong>Oil:</strong> A pint of oil burns for 6 hours in a lantern. You can use a flask of oil as a splash weapon. Use the rules for alchemist's fire, except that it takes a full round action to prepare a flask with a fuse. Once it is thrown, there is a 50% chance of the flask igniting successfully.</p>
<p>You can pour a pint of oil on the ground to cover an area 5 feet square, provided that the surface is smooth. If lit, the oil burns for 2 rounds and deals 1d3 points of fire damage to each creature in the area.</p>
<p id="ram-portable"><strong>Ram, Portable:</strong> This iron-shod wooden beam gives you a +2 circumstance bonus on Strength checks made to break open a door and it allows a second person to help you without having to roll, increasing your bonus by 2.</p>
<p id="rope-hemp"><strong>Rope, Hempen:</strong> This rope has 2 hit points and can be burst with a DC 23 Strength check.</p>
<p id="rope-silk"><strong>Rope, Silk:</strong> This rope has 4 hit points and can be burst with a DC 24 Strength check. It is so supple that it provides a +2 circumstance bonus on <em>use rope</em> checks.</p>
<p id="spyglass"><strong>Spyglass:</strong> Objects viewed through a spyglass are magnified to twice their size.</p>
<p id="torch"><strong>Torch:</strong> A torch burns for 1 hour, clearly illuminating a 20-foot radius and providing shadowy illumination out to a 40- foot radius. If a torch is used in combat, treat it as a one-handed improvised weapon that deals bludgeoning damage equal to that of a gauntlet of its size, plus 1 point of fire damage.</p>
<p id="vial"><strong>Vial:</strong> A vial holds 1 ounce of liquid. The stoppered container usually is no more than 1 inch wide and 3 inches high.</p>

<p>Any of these substances except for the everburning torch and holy water can be made by a character with the <em>craft (alchemy)</em> skill.</p>
<p id="acid"><strong>Acid:</strong> You can throw a flask of acid as a splash weapon. Treat this attack as a ranged touch attack with a range increment of 10 feet. A direct hit deals 1d6 points of acid damage. Every creature within 5 feet of the point where the acid hits takes 1 point of acid damage from the splash.</p>
<p id="alchemists-fire"><strong>Alchemist's Fire:</strong> You can throw a flask of alchemist's fire as a splash weapon. Treat this attack as a ranged touch attack with a range increment of 10 feet.</p>
<p>A direct hit deals 1d6 points of fire damage. Every creature within 5 feet of the point where the flask hits takes 1 point of fire damage from the splash. On the round following a direct hit, the target takes an additional 1d6 points of damage. If desired, the target can use a full-round action to attempt to extinguish the flames before taking this additional damage. Extinguishing the flames requires a DC 15 Reflex save. Rolling on the ground provides the target a +2 bonus on the save. Leaping into a lake or magically extinguishing the flames automatically smothers the fire.</p>
<p id="antitoxin"><strong>Antitoxin:</strong> If you drink antitoxin, you get a +5 alchemical bonus on Fortitude saving throws against poison for 1 hour.</p>
<p id="everburning-torch"><strong>Everburning Torch:</strong> This otherwise normal torch has a continual flame spell cast upon it. An everburning torch clearly illuminates a 20-foot radius and provides shadowy illumination out to a 40-foot radius.</p>
<p id="holy-water"><strong>Holy Water:</strong> Holy water damages undead creatures and evil outsiders almost as if it were acid. A flask of holy water can be thrown as a splash weapon.</p>
<p>Treat this attack as a ranged touch attack with a range increment of 10 feet. A flask breaks if thrown against the body of a corporeal creature, but to use it against an incorporeal creature, you must open the flask and pour the holy water out onto the target. Thus, you can douse an incorporeal creature with holy water only if you are adjacent to it. Doing so is a ranged touch attack that does not provoke attacks of opportunity.</p>
<p>A direct hit by a flask of holy water deals 2d4 points of damage to an undead creature or an evil outsider. Each such creature within 5 feet of the point where the flask hits takes 1 point of damage from the splash.</p>
<p>Temples to good deities sell holy water at cost (making no profit).</p>
<p id="smokestick"><strong>Smokestick:</strong> This alchemically treated wooden stick instantly creates thick, opaque smoke when ignited. The smoke fills a 10- foot cube (treat the effect as a fog cloud spell, except that a moderate or stronger wind dissipates the smoke in 1 round). The stick is consumed after 1 round, and the smoke dissipates naturally.</p>
<p id="sunrod"><strong>Sunrod:</strong> This 1-foot-long, gold-tipped, iron rod glows brightly when struck. It clearly illuminates a 30-foot radius and provides shadowy illumination in a 60-foot radius. It glows for 6 hours, after which the gold tip is burned out and worthless.</p>
<p>Tanglefoot Bag: When you throw a tanglefoot bag at a creature (as a ranged touch attack with a range increment of 10 feet), the bag comes apart and the goo bursts out, entangling the target and then becoming tough and resilient upon exposure to air. An entangled creature takes a -2 penalty on attack rolls and a -4 penalty to Dexterity and must make a DC 15 Reflex save or be glued to the floor, unable to move. Even on a successful save, it can move only at half speed. Huge or larger creatures are unaffected by a tanglefoot bag. A flying creature is not stuck to the floor, but it must make a DC 15 Reflex save or be unable to fly (assuming it uses its wings to fly) and fall to the ground. A tanglefoot bag does not function underwater.</p>
<p>A creature that is glued to the floor (or unable to fly) can break free by making a DC 17 Strength check or by dealing 15 points of damage to the goo with a slashing weapon. A creature trying to scrape goo off itself, or another creature assisting, does not need to make an attack roll; hitting the goo is automatic, after which the creature that hit makes a damage roll to see how much of the goo was scraped off. Once free, the creature can move (including flying) at half speed. A character capable of spellcasting who is bound by the goo must make a DC 15 Concentration check to cast a spell. The goo becomes brittle and fragile after 2d4 rounds, cracking apart and losing its effectiveness. An application of universal solvent to a stuck creature dissolves the alchemical goo immediately.</p>
<p id="thunderstone"><strong>Thunderstone:</strong> You can throw this stone as a ranged attack with a range increment of 20 feet. When it strikes a hard surface (or is struck hard), it creates a deafening bang that is treated as a sonic attack. Each creature within a 10-foot-radius spread must make a DC 15 Fortitude save or be deafened for 1 hour. A deafened creature, in addition to the obvious effects, takes a -4 penalty on initiative and has a 20% chance to miscast and lose any spell with a verbal component that it tries to cast.</p>
<p>Since you don't need to hit a specific target, you can simply aim at a particular 5-foot square. Treat the target square as AC 5.</p>
<p id="tindertwig"><strong>Tindertwig:</strong> The alchemical substance on the end of this small, wooden stick ignites when struck against a rough surface. Creating a flame with a tindertwig is much faster than creating a flame with flint and steel (or a magnifying glass) and tinder. Lighting a torch with a tindertwig is a standard action (rather than a full-round action), and lighting any other fire with one is at least a standard action.</p>

<p id="alchemists-lab"><strong>Alchemist's Lab:</strong> An alchemist's lab always has the perfect tool for making alchemical items, so it provides a +2 circumstance bonus on <em>craft (alchemy)</em> checks. It has no bearing on the costs related to the <em>craft (alchemy)</em> skill. Without this lab, a character with the <em>craft (alchemy)</em> skill is assumed to have enough tools to use the skill but not enough to get the +2 bonus that the lab provides.</p>
<p id="artisans-tools"><strong>Artisan's Tools:</strong> These special tools include the items needed to pursue any craft. Without them, you have to use improvised tools (-2 penalty on <em>craft</em> checks), if you can do the job at all.</p>
<p id="artisans-tools-masterwork"><strong>Artisan's Tools, Masterwork:</strong> These tools serve the same purpose as artisan's tools (above), but masterwork artisan's tools are the perfect tools for the job, so you get a +2 circumstance bonus on <em>craft</em> checks made with them.</p>
<p id="climbers-kit"><strong>Climber's Kit:</strong> This is the perfect tool for climbing and gives you a +2 circumstance bonus on <em>climb</em> checks.</p>
<p id="codex"><strong>Codex:</strong> This item looks much like a scroll case. However, it has several (3 to 6) bands near the center. These can be rotated around the cylinder, and are typically covered with runes or numbers, though some may have magical writing only visible with certain spells. The premise of a codex is to safely store documents or plans of extreme secrecy or importance. Inside, the paper to be protected is wrapped around a vial of acid or other corrosive substance. When the codex is locked, any attempt to forcibly open it will cause a small hammer to break the vial, destroying the document. Due to their nature, codices are very rare and expensive. However, when a normal lock will not suffice and magic is not an option, they are a viable alternative. Without the proper code, the codex cannot be unlocked.</p>
<p>When unlocked, one end of the codex slides off to reveal the hollow area. However, if this area is pulled with the wrong combination word (ie - someone is trying to guess the password), there is a 10% chance the hammer will break the vial inside.</p>
<p>Because of the nature of a codex, the <em><a href="#">knock</a></em> spell is not sufficient to open the container. Since codices consist of at least three separate locking mechanisms, each casting of the <em><a href="#">knock</a></em> spell is only able to unlock up to two at a time, meaning that at all times, at least one of the mechanisms remains locked and protecting the information stored inside.</p>

<p id="disguise-kit"><strong>Disguise Kit:</strong> The kit is the perfect tool for disguise and provides a +2 circumstance bonus on <em>disguise</em> checks. A disguise kit is exhausted after ten uses.</p>
<p id="healers-kit"><strong>Healer's Kit:</strong> It is the perfect tool for healing and provides a +2 circumstance bonus on <em>heal</em> checks. A healer's kit is exhausted after ten uses.</p>
<p id="holy-symbol"><strong>Holy Symbol, Silver or Wooden:</strong> A holy symbol focuses positive energy. A cleric or paladin uses it as the focus for his spells and as a tool for turning undead. Each religion has its own holy symbol.</p>
<p id="unholy-symbol"><strong>Unholy Symbols:</strong> An unholy symbol is like a holy symbol except that it focuses negative energy and is used by evil clerics (or by neutral clerics who want to cast evil spells or command undead).</p>
<p id="magnifying-glass"><strong>Magnifying Glass:</strong> This simple lens allows a closer look at small objects. It is also useful as a substitute for flint and steel when starting fires. Lighting a fire with a magnifying glass requires light as bright as sunlight to focus, tinder to ignite, and at least a full-round action. A magnifying glass grants a +2 circumstance bonus on <em>appraise</em> checks involving any item that is small or highly detailed.</p>
<p id="musical-instrument"><strong>Musical Instrument, Common or Masterwork:</strong> A masterwork instrument grants a +2 circumstance bonus on <em>perform</em> checks involving its use.</p>
<p id="potion-belt"><strong>Potion Belt:</strong> This broad leather belt has a large steel clasp in the front. It is made of thick, tough leather to hold the weight of several flasks of liquid or vials of potions and poisons. Typical potion belts have eight leather straps, four on each side, that can be fitted around the neck of a flask or vial, securing it to the belt. An item secured in this manner may be retrieved as a move action.</p>
<p>If the character has the <a href="#">Quick Draw</a> feat, drawing a flask or vial may be done as a free action.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This item only allows a character to grasp a flask or vial. Drinking a potion or applying an oil is still a standard action that provokes an attack of opportunity.</p>
<p id="scale-merchants"><strong>Scale, Merchant's:</strong> A scale grants a +2 circumstance bonus on <em>appraise</em> checks involving items that are valued by weight, including anything made of precious metals.</p>
<p id="scroll-bandolier"><strong>Scroll Bandolier:</strong> This bandolier is made of a flexible leather or cloth. It is a non-magical item with several small pouches along its length, allowing a character to store up to ten scrolls for easy retrieval. As a move action, a character may draw a scroll from the bandolier to cast the spell.</p>
<p>If the character has the <a href="#">Quick Draw</a> feat, this may be done as a free action.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Casting a spell from a scroll is still a standard action that provokes an attack of opportunity.</p>
<p id="spell-component-pouch"><strong>Spell Component Pouch:</strong> A spellcaster with a spell component pouch is assumed to have all the material components and focuses needed for spellcasting, except for those components that have a specific cost, divine focuses, and focuses that wouldn't fit in a pouch.</p>
<p id="spellbook-blank"><strong>Spellbook, Wizard's (Blank):</strong> A spellbook has 100 pages of parchment, and each spell takes up one page per spell level (one page each for 0-level spells).</p>
<p id="thieves-tools"><strong>Thieves' Tools:</strong> This kit contains the tools you need to use the <em>disable device</em> and <em>open lock</em> skills. Without these tools, you must improvise tools, and you take a -2 circumstance penalty on <em>disable device</em> and <em>open lock</em> checks.</p>
<p id="thieves-tools-masterwork"><strong>Thieves' Tools, Masterwork:</strong> This kit contains extra tools and tools of better make, which grant a +2 circumstance bonus on <em>disable device</em> and <em>open lock</em> checks.</p>
<p id="tool-masterwork"><strong>Tool, Masterwork:</strong> This well-made item is the perfect tool for the job. It grants a +2 circumstance bonus on a related skill check (if any). Bonuses provided by multiple masterwork items used toward the same skill check do not stack.</p>
<p id="water-clock"><strong>Water Clock:</strong> This large, bulky contrivance gives the time accurate to within half an hour per day since it was last set. It requires a source of water, and it must be kept still because it marks time by the regulated flow of droplets of water.</p>

<p id="artisans-outfit"><strong>Artisan's Outfit:</strong> This outfit includes a shirt with buttons, a skirt or pants with a drawstring, shoes, and perhaps a cap or hat. It may also include a belt or a leather or cloth apron for carrying tools.</p>
<p id="clerics-vestments"><strong>Cleric's Vestments:</strong> These ecclesiastical clothes are for performing priestly functions, not for adventuring.</p>
<p id="cold-weather-outfit"><strong>Cold Weather Outfit:</strong> A cold weather outfit includes a wool coat, linen shirt, wool cap, heavy cloak, thick pants or skirt, and boots. This outfit grants a +5 circumstance bonus on Fortitude saving throws against exposure to cold weather.</p>
<p id="courtiers-outfit"><strong>Courtier's Outfit:</strong> This outfit includes fancy, tailored clothes in whatever fashion happens to be the current style in the courts of the nobles. Anyone trying to influence nobles or courtiers while wearing street dress will have a hard time of it (-2 penalty on Charisma-based skill checks to influence such individuals). If you wear this outfit without jewelry (costing an additional 50 gp), you look like an out-of-place commoner.</p>
<p id="entertainers-outfit"><strong>Entertainer's Outfit:</strong> This set of flashy, perhaps even gaudy, clothes is for entertaining. While the outfit looks whimsical, its practical design lets you tumble, dance, walk a tightrope, or just run (if the audience turns ugly).</p>
<p id="explorers-outfit"><strong>Explorer's Outfit:</strong> This is a full set of clothes for someone who never knows what to expect. It includes sturdy boots, leather breeches or a skirt, a belt, a shirt (perhaps with a vest or jacket), gloves, and a cloak. Rather than a leather skirt, a leather overtunic may be worn over a cloth skirt. The clothes have plenty of pockets (especially the cloak). The outfit also includes any extra items you might need, such as a scarf or a wide-brimmed hat.</p>
<p id="monks-outfit"><strong>Monk's Outfit:</strong> This simple outfit includes sandals, loose breeches, and a loose shirt, and is all bound together with sashes. The outfit is designed to give you maximum mobility, and it's made of high-quality fabric. You can hide small weapons in pockets hidden in the folds, and the sashes are strong enough to serve as short ropes.</p>
<p id="nobles-outfit"><strong>Noble's Outfit:</strong> This set of clothes is designed specifically to be expensive and to show it. Precious metals and gems are worked into the clothing. To fit into the noble crowd, every would-be noble also needs a signet ring (see Adventuring Gear, above) and jewelry (worth at least 100 gp).</p>
<p id="peasants-outfit"><strong>Peasant's Outfit:</strong> This set of clothes consists of a loose shirt and baggy breeches, or a loose shirt and skirt or overdress. Cloth wrappings are used for shoes.</p>
<p id="royal-outfit"><strong>Royal Outfit:</strong> This is just the clothing, not the royal scepter, crown, ring, and other accoutrements. Royal clothes are ostentatious, with gems, gold, silk, and fur in abundance.</p>

<p id="barding"><strong>Barding, Medium Creature and Large Creature:</strong> Barding is a type of armor that covers the head, neck, chest, body, and possibly legs of a horse or other mount. Barding made of medium or heavy armor provides better protection than light barding, but at the expense of speed. Barding can be made of any of the armor types found on Table: Armor and Shields.</p>
<p>Armor for a horse (a Large nonhumanoid creature) costs four times as much as armor for a human (a Medium humanoid creature) and also weighs twice as much as the armor found on Table: Armor and Shields (see Armor for Unusual Creatures). If the barding is for a pony or other Medium mount, the cost is only double, and the weight is the same as for Medium armor worn by a humanoid. Medium or heavy barding slows a mount that wears it, as shown on the table below.</p>

<p>Removing and fitting barding takes five times as long as the figures given on Table: Donning Armor. A barded animal cannot be used to carry any load other than the rider and normal saddlebags.</p>
<p id="dog-riding"><strong>Dog, Riding:</strong> This Medium dog is specially trained to carry a Small humanoid rider. It is brave in combat like a warhorse. You take no damage when you fall from a riding dog.</p>
<p id="donkey-mule"><strong>Donkey or Mule:</strong> Donkeys and mules are stolid in the face of danger, hardy, surefooted, and capable of carrying heavy loads over vast distances. Unlike a horse, a donkey or a mule is willing (though not eager) to enter dungeons and other strange or threatening places.</p>
<p id="feed"><strong>Feed:</strong> Horses, donkeys, mules, and ponies can graze to sustain themselves, but providing feed for them is much better. If you have a riding dog, you have to feed it at least some meat.</p>
<p id="horse"><strong>Horse:</strong> A horse (other than a pony) is suitable as a mount for a human, dwarf, elf, half-elf, or half-orc. A pony is smaller than a horse and is a suitable mount for a gnome or halfling.</p>
<p>Warhorses and warponies can be ridden easily into combat. Light horses, ponies, and heavy horses are hard to control in combat.</p>
<p id="saddle-exotic"><strong>Saddle, Exotic:</strong> An exotic saddle is like a normal saddle of the same sort except that it is designed for an unusual mount. Exotic saddles come in military, pack, and riding styles.</p>
<p id="saddle-military"><strong>Saddle, Military:</strong> A military saddle braces the rider, providing a +2 circumstance bonus on <em>ride</em> checks related to staying in the saddle. If you're knocked unconscious while in a military saddle, you have a 75% chance to stay in the saddle (compared to 50% for a riding saddle).</p>
<p id="saddle-pack"><strong>Saddle, Pack:</strong> A pack saddle holds gear and supplies, but not a rider. It holds as much gear as the mount can carry.</p>
<p id="saddle-riding"><strong>Saddle, Riding:</strong> The standard riding saddle supports a rider.</p>

<p id="carriage"><strong>Carriage:</strong> This four-wheeled vehicle can transport as many as four people within an enclosed cab, plus two drivers. In general, two horses (or other beasts of burden) draw it. A carriage comes with the harness needed to pull it.</p>
<p id="cart"><strong>Cart:</strong> This two-wheeled vehicle can be drawn by a single horse (or other beast of burden). It comes with a harness.</p>
<p id="galley"><strong>Galley:</strong> This three-masted ship has seventy oars on either side and requires a total crew of 200. A galley is 130 feet long and 20 feet wide, and it can carry 150 tons of cargo or 250 soldiers. For 8,000 gp more, it can be fitted with a ram and castles with firing platforms fore, aft, and amidships. This ship cannot make sea voyages and sticks to the coast. It moves about 4 miles per hour when being rowed or under sail.</p>
<p id="keelboat"><strong>Keelboat:</strong> This 50- to 75-foot-long ship is 15 to 20 feet wide and has a few oars to supplement its single mast with a square sail. It has a crew of eight to fifteen and can carry 40 to 50 tons of cargo or 100 soldiers. It can make sea voyages, as well as sail down rivers (thanks to its flat bottom). It moves about 1 mile per hour.</p>
<p id="longship"><strong>Longship:</strong> This 75-foot-long ship with forty oars requires a total crew of 50. It has a single mast and a square sail, and it can carry 50 tons of cargo or 120 soldiers. A longship can make sea voyages. It moves about 3 miles per hour when being rowed or under sail.</p>
<p id="rowboat"><strong>Rowboat:</strong> This 8- to 12-foot-long boat holds two or three Medium passengers. It moves about 1-1/2 miles per hour.</p>
<p id="sailing-ship"><strong>Sailing Ship:</strong> This larger, seaworthy ship is 75 to 90 feet long and 20 feet wide and has a crew of 20. It can carry 150 tons of cargo. It has square sails on its two masts and can make sea voyages. It moves about 2 miles per hour.</p>
<p id="sled"><strong>Sled:</strong> This is a wagon on runners for moving through snow and over ice. In general, two horses (or other beasts of burden) draw it. A sled comes with the harness needed to pull it.</p>
<p id="wagon"><strong>Wagon:</strong> This is a four-wheeled, open vehicle for transporting heavy loads. In general, two horses (or other beasts of burden) draw it. A wagon comes with the harness needed to pull it.</p>
<p id="warship"><strong>Warship:</strong> This 100-foot-long ship has a single mast, although oars can also propel it. It has a crew of 60 to 80 rowers. This ship can carry 160 soldiers, but not for long distances, since there isn't room for supplies to support that many people. The warship cannot make sea voyages and sticks to the coast. It is not used for cargo. It moves about 2-1/2 miles per hour when being rowed or under sail.</p>

<p>Sometimes the best solution for a problem is to hire someone else to take care of it.</p>
<p id="coach-cab"><strong>Coach Cab:</strong> The price given is for a ride in a coach that transports people (and light cargo) between towns. For a ride in a cab that transports passengers within a city, 1 copper piece usually takes you anywhere you need to go.</p>
<p id="hireling-trained"><strong>Hireling, Trained:</strong> The amount given is the typical daily wage for mercenary warriors, masons, craftsmen, scribes, teamsters, and other trained hirelings. This value represents a minimum wage; many such hirelings require significantly higher pay.</p>
<p id="hireling-untrained"><strong>Hireling, Untrained:</strong> The amount shown is the typical daily wage for laborers, porters, cooks, maids, and other menial workers.</p>
<p id="messenger"><strong>Messenger:</strong> This entry includes horse-riding messengers and runners. Those willing to carry a message to a place they were going anyway may ask for only half the indicated amount.</p>
<p id="road-gate-toll"><strong>Road or Gate Toll:</strong> A toll is sometimes charged to cross a well-trodden, well-kept, and well-guarded road to pay for patrols on it and for its upkeep. Occasionally, a large walled city charges a toll to enter or exit (or sometimes just to enter).</p>
<p id="ships-passage"><strong>Ship's Passage:</strong> Most ships do not specialize in passengers, but many have the capability to take a few along when transporting cargo. Double the given cost for creatures larger than Medium or creatures that are otherwise difficult to bring aboard a ship.</p>
<p id="spell"><strong>Spell:</strong> The indicated amount is how much it costs to get a spellcaster to cast a spell for you. This cost assumes that you can go to the spellcaster and have the spell cast at his or her convenience (generally at least 24 hours later, so that the spellcaster has time to prepare the spell in question). If you want to bring the spellcaster somewhere to cast a spell you need to negotiate with him or her, and the default answer is no.</p>
<p>The cost given is for a spell with no cost for a material component or focus component and no XP cost. If the spell includes a material component, add the cost of that component to the cost of the spell.</p>
<p>If the spell has a focus component (other than a divine focus), add 1/10 the cost of that focus to the cost of the spell. If the spell has an XP cost, add 5 gp per XP lost. Furthermore, if a spell has dangerous consequences, the spellcaster will certainly require proof that you can and will pay for dealing with any such consequences (that is, assuming that the spellcaster even agrees to cast such a spell, which isn't certain). In the case of spells that transport the caster and characters over a distance, you will likely have to pay for two castings of the spell, even if you aren't returning with the caster.</p>
<p>In addition, not every town or village has a spellcaster of sufficient level to cast any spell. In general, you must travel to a small town (or larger settlement) to be reasonably assured of finding a spellcaster capable of casting 1st-level spells, a large town for 2nd-level spells, a small city for 3rd- or 4th-level spells, a large city for 5th- or 6th-level spells, and a metropolis for 7th- or 8th-level spells. Even a metropolis isn't guaranteed to have a local spellcaster able to cast 9th-level spells.</p>
