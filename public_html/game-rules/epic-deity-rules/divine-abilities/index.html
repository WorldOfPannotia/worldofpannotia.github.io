        <h3>Salient Divine Abilities</h3>
<p>A salient divine ability is like a feat &ndash; it gives a deity a new capability or improves one that the deity already has. A deity has one salient divine ability for each divine rank the deity has, plus additional salient divine abilities reflecting its status: Demigods receive one bonus ability, lesser deities receive two bonus abilities, intermediate deities receive three, and greater deities receive five.</p>
<p>Some salient divine abilities have prerequisites. Usually, the deity must have all the listed prerequisites to have the ability. A divine rank of 1 is a prerequisite for all salient divine abilities. The most common salient divine abilities are described here. Some deities may have unique salient divine abilities. These abilities are described in the deity's individual entry.</p>
<p><strong>Using Salient Divine Abilities:</strong> Using a salient divine ability is a standard action unless otherwise noted in the ability description. Using a salient divine ability does not provoke an attack of opportunity.</p>
<p><strong>Salient Divine Abilities and Antimagic:</strong> A salient divine ability functions normally within an antimagic field, and is never subject to spell resistance.</p>
<p>Here is the format for salient divine ability descriptions.</p>
<div class="sf-box">
    <h4>Ability Name</h4>
    <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> A minimum divine rank, minimum ability score, another salient divine ability, a minimum base attack bonus, a feat, a skill, or some other condition that a deity must have in order to acquire this salient divine ability. This entry is absent if a salient divine ability has no prerequisite. An ability may have more than one prerequisite. All salient divine abilities have a minimum prerequisite of divine rank 1. Quasi-deities (rank 0) have no salient divine abilities.</p>
    <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> What the ability enables the deity to do. If a deity has the same ability more than once, its benefits do not stack unless indicated otherwise in the description. In general, having a salient divine ability twice is the same as having it once.</p>
    <p><strong>Notes:</strong> Additional facts about the ability that may be helpful when using the ability in play.</p>
    <p><strong>Rest:</strong> Some abilities require the deity to rest afterward. If no rest is required, the entry is absent. A resting deity can engage in light activities such as talking or walking at half speed. When attempting anything more strenuous than that, the deity can only take partial actions and suffers a -6 penalty on all attack rolls, saves, and checks. The deity cannot use another ability that requires rest until its current rest requirement is fulfilled. Any time the deity spends performing strenuous activities does not count toward the required rest time.</p>
    <p><strong>Suggested Portfolio Elements:</strong> This entry gives one or more portfolio elements that are associated with the salient divine ability in question. The information is provided as guidance and should not be taken as a rule.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="descriptions">Salient Divine Ability Descriptions</h3>
<div id="alter-form" class="sf-box">
    <h4>Alter Form</h4>
    <p>This is an extraordinary ability.</p>
    <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Alter Size salient divine ability.</p>
    <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> As a move-equivalent action, the deity can alter its form, including clothing and equipment. The assumed form must be corporeal. The deity's body can undergo a limited physical transmutation, including adding or subtracting one or two limbs. If the form selected has wings, the deity can fly. Likewise, the deity can swim if the form has fins, breathe water if the form has gills, and so on.</p>
    <p>The deity can remain in the altered form indefinitely, but resumes its own form if slain.</p>
    <p><strong>Notes:</strong> The deity's attack bonus, Armor Class, and saves do not change. The deity does not gain any of the assumed form's special abilities, attack forms, defenses, ability scores, or mannerisms. The deity can change physical qualities (such as hair color, hair texture, skin color, and gender). The deity can use this ability to create disguises, gaining a bonus of +10 on its <em>disguise</em> checks. The deity can use its Alter Size ability simultaneously along with this one to become taller, shorter, thinner, or heavier.</p>
    <p><strong>Suggested Portfolio Elements:</strong> Nature, secrets, thieves.</p>
</div>

<div id="alter-reality" class="sf-box">
    <h4>Alter Reality</h4>
    <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Cha 29.</p>
    <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> This ability is similar to the <em>wish</em> spell. The deity merely thinks of something and then makes it so. Doing this requires at least a standard action.</p>
    <p><strong>Notes:</strong> The deity can duplicate any spell of 9th level or lower as a standard action. The duplicated spell has no material or XP component, and the DC of its saving throw (if one is allowed) is 20 + the deity's rank + the deity's Charisma modifier.</p>
    <p>The deity also can duplicate a spell with any metamagic feat (so long as the metamagic feat is available to characters of 20th level or lower). This use of the ability requires the deity to rest for 1 round for each level that the feat would normally add to the spell. It still takes a standard action to use this ability, so there is no point in using the ability to duplicate a quickened spell.</p>
    <p>The deity can render a magical or supernatural effect permanent. The rest requirement varies with the effect: 10 minutes per level of the effect times the number of subjects affected, 10 minutes per total Hit Dice of creatures affected, or 10 minutes per 10-foot cube affected. Use the highest applicable value.</p>
    <p>The deity can create temporary, nonmagical objects. This works like the Create Object ability (including the required rest period), except that the items last one day per rank.</p>
    <p>The deity also can create permanent nonmagical objects as if using the Create Object ability except that all rest requirements are doubled and there is no reduction in rest time for being on an Outer Plane or in the deity's own realm.</p>
    <p>The deity can create temporary magic items or creatures. This works like the Divine Creation ability (including the required rest period), except that the items or creatures created last 1 hour per rank. This ability cannot create permanent magic items or creatures.</p>
    <p>The deity can reshape a landscape, creating any type of terrain the deity can imagine. Each 10-foot cube of material to be reshaped requires 1 round of effort, and the deity must rest for one day per 10-foot cube shaped after the work is completed.</p>
    <p><strong>Suggested Portfolio Elements:</strong> Any.</p>
</div>

<div id="alter-size" class="sf-box">
    <h4>Alter Size</h4>
    <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> As a free action, the deity can assume any size from Fine to Colossal. The deity also can change the size of up to 100 pounds of objects it touches. If the deity has a familiar, personal mount, or personal intelligent weapon, the creature can change size with the deity if the deity touches it, but its weight counts against the deity's weight limit. This is a supernatural ability.</p>
    <p><strong>Notes:</strong> This ability allows the deity to assume any proportions from the size of a grain of sand up or as much as 1,600 feet tall. A radical change in size can have great impact on the deity's combat ability. The deity's Strength, Armor Class, attack bonus, and damage dealt with weapons changes according to the size the deity assumes. The deity's Strength score can never be reduced to less than 1 through this ability. Also note that use of this divine ability does not affect all the deities' characteristics.</p>
    <p><strong>Suggested Portfolio Elements:</strong> Any.</p>
</div>

<div id="annihilating-strike" class="sf-box">
    <h4>Annihilating Strike</h4>
    <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Divine rank 11, base attack bonus +20, Str 25.</p>
    <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> When the deity strikes with a weapon or natural weapon, the opponent struck might be obliterated. Creatures, attended objects, and magic items must make Fortitude saves (DC 20 + the deity's rank + the damage dealt) or be reduced to -10 hit points and killed outright. Unattended, nonmagical objects are obliterated. The deity can destroy up to 1,000 cubic feet (a 10-foot cube) of nonliving matter per rank, so the ability destroys only part of any very large object or structure targeted.</p>
    <p><strong>Notes:</strong> Deities with a rank equal to or greater than the attacking deity are not subject to this ability. This ability has no effect on objects or effects that are not subject to physical attacks.</p>
    <p><strong>Suggested Portfolio Elements:</strong> Death, justice, vengeance, war.</p>
</div>

<div id="arcane-mastery" class="sf-box">
    <h4>Arcane Mastery</h4>
    <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Spellcaster level 1st, Int 29, Spell Mastery.</p>
    <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> The deity can prepare any wizard spell that it can cast without using a spellbook.</p>
    <p><strong>Notes:</strong> This ability gives the deity access to every spell on the sorcerer/wizard spell list, provided that the deity has sufficient wizard levels and a sufficient Intelligence score to cast them. The deity also can invent new sorcerer/wizard spells without researching them.</p>
    <p><strong>Suggested Portfolio Elements:</strong> Knowledge, magic.</p>
</div>

<div id="area-divine-shield" class="sf-box">
    <h4>Area Divine Shield</h4>
    <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Divine rank 6, Cha 29, Divine Shield salient divine ability.</p>
    <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Except where noted here, this ability works like the Divine Shield ability. The deity produces a transparent barrier whose area is up to one 10-foot square per rank, or a sphere or hemisphere with a radius of up to 1 foot per rank. The barrier can be placed anywhere within the deity's line of sight. The deity can place the barrier so that it is mobile with respect to some unattended object or willing creature. The barrier can be adjusted to ignore certain types of damage, just as a divine shield can. If the deity makes the shield mobile with respect to a willing creature, the deity also can make the barrier one-way with respect to the creature and its allies, allowing them to attack through the shield and still use its protection.</p>
    <p><strong>Notes:</strong> The deity can shape the shield around itself or around a willing creature so that it is skintight, which prevents the subject from being touched.</p>
    <p><strong>Suggested Portfolio Elements:</strong> Mercy, protection.</p>
</div>

<div id="automatic-metamagic" class="sf-box">
    <h4>Automatic Metamagic</h4>
    <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Spellcaster level 1st.</p>
    <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> The deity chooses one metamagic feat. As a free action, the deity can apply the selected feat to the spells from any one spellcasting class the deity has or to its spell-like abilities. A spell altered by the use of this ability does not use up a higher-level slot.</p>
    <p><strong>Notes:</strong> The deity must obey all the limitations normally associated with the metamagic feat. Any metamagic feat selected cannot have a level requirement of 21st or higher. Feats that depend on making the spell's level higher, such as Heighten Spell, do not work with this ability. A deity can have this ability multiple times, choosing a metamagic feat and either a spellcasting class or spell-like abilities to which the ability will apply each time.</p>
    <p><strong>Suggested Portfolio Elements:</strong> Knowledge, magic.</p>
</div>

<div id="avatar" class="sf-box">
    <h4>Avatar</h4>
    <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Divine rank 6, Cha 29.</p>
    <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> An avatar serves as a deity's alter ego, effectively allowing the deity to be in two or more places at the same time. An avatar is an extension of a deity. The deity senses and knows everything the avatar senses and knows and vice versa. Each avatar counts as a remote location where the deity is sensing and communicating. A lesser deity can have up to five avatars at once, an intermediate deity can have up to ten, and a greater deity can have up to twenty avatars at once. It takes a deity one year to create an avatar or replace a destroyed avatar. The process does not require any special effort on the deity's part. An avatar must be created in the deity's own realm. If the deity has the Divine Creation salient divine ability, the deity can use it to create a new avatar anywhere. However, the deity must rest afterward as noted in the Divine Creation ability description. An avatar is a less powerful version of a deity, created by modifying the deity's statistics, that has the following characteristics.</p>
    <p><em>Divine Rank:</em> The avatar's divine rank is half that of the deity (round down). This decrease in divine rank affects many of the avatar's statistics and abilities, including bonuses to attack rolls, damage, saves, checks, and Armor Class, damage reduction, resistances, number of salient divine abilities and bonus salient divine abilities, uses per day of domain powers, saving throw DCs against spell-like abilities, range of senses, automatic actions, magic items it can create, and extent of divine aura. The deity's ability scores, speed, class levels, and Hit Dice are unchanged.</p>
    <p><em>Divine Abilities:</em> The avatar has salient divine abilities according to its own divine rank. The deity chooses which of its abilities the avatar has when creating the avatar. The avatar cannot have a salient divine ability that is not available to a deity of its own rank, nor can it use a salient divine ability if it doesn't meet the prerequisites. An avatar cannot have the Avatar or Possess Mortal salient divine abilities.</p>
    <p>An avatar does not have any remote sensing or remote communication powers.</p>
    <p><strong>Suggested Portfolio Elements:</strong> Any.</p>
</div>

<div id="banestrike" class="sf-box">
    <h4>Banestrike</h4>
    <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Base attack bonus +20.</p>
    <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Any weapon the deity weilds gains a bonus of +4 on attack rolls, and it deals an extra +4d6 points of damage against the designated foe. The bonus and extra damage stack with any other properties the weapon has.</p>
    <p><strong>Notes:</strong> The deity selects one kind of enemy from the list below.</p>
    <table id="banestrike-table" class="table table-bordered table-hover">
        <caption>Table: Banestrike Enemy Types</caption>
        <thead>
            <tr><th>Enemy Type</th><th>Enemy Type</th></tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr><td>Aberrations</td><td>Oozes</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Animals</td><td>Outsiders, chaotic</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Beasts</td><td>Outsiders, evil</td></tr>

            <tr><td>Fey</td><td>Undead</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Giants</td><td>Vermin</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Monstrous humanoids</td><td>Humanoids (choose one subtype)</td></tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>The ability functions only when the deity personally attacks with a melee weapon or ranged weapon. The deity can apply the Banestrike ability to any weapon or natural weapon, but not to a spell, spell-like ability, supernatural ability, or divine ability.</p>
    <p>A deity can have this ability multiple times, choosing a different kind of foe each time. The deity can imbue only one bane special ability to a weapon at a time and can change among them once a round as a free action.</p>
    <p><strong>Suggested Portfolio Elements:</strong> Death, justice, vengeance, war.</p>
</div>

<div id="battlesense" class="sf-box">
    <h4>Battlesense</h4>
    <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> The deity cannot be surprised or flanked except by a deity of higher rank. The deity retains its Dexterity bonus to Armor Class even if caught flat-footed or attacked by an invisible opponent, and is not subject to sneak attacks except by deities of higher rank.</p>
    <p><strong>Notes:</strong> If the deity has the uncanny dodge or improved uncanny dodge class feature, this ability replaces it.</p>
    <p><strong>Suggested Portfolio Elements:</strong> War.</p>
</div>

<div id="call-creatures" class="sf-box">
    <h4>Call Creatures</h4>
    <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> The kind of creature the deity can call is noted in the deity's description. Each creature called can have no more Hit Dice than the deity has divine ranks, and the deity cannot have more creatures serving it at any given time than the deity has ranks. The creatures are transported to the deity's presence through an interdimensional connection similar to that created by a <em>gate</em> spell, except that it opens to the Material Plane. The creatures willingly serve to the best of their ability. The calling effect is otherwise similar to the calling property of the <em>gate</em> spell.</p>
    <p><strong>Notes:</strong> A deity can have this ability multiple times, choosing a different kind of creature each time.</p>
    <p><strong>Suggested Portfolio Elements:</strong> Any.</p>
</div>

<div id="clearsight" class="sf-box">
    <h4>Clearsight</h4>
    <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Divine rank 6, Wis 29.</p>
    <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> The deity can see illusions, transmuted creatures and objects, and disguised creatures or objects for what they really are, provided they are within 10 feet per divine rank of the deity. This ability is similar to the <em>true seeing</em> spell, except that it does not reveal creatures' alignments and it does foil mundane disguises.</p>
    <p><strong>Suggested Portfolio Elements:</strong> Knowledge, truth.</p>
</div>

<div id="command-plants" class="sf-box">
    <h4>Command Plants</h4>
    <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> The deity can make plants grow in a radius of up to one mile per divine rank once per day. The deity can use this ability even in a place where no plants grow, though in this case the plants wither and die after one day. This ability works like the <em>plant growth</em> spell, except that it cannot be countered except by a deity of higher rank than the deity using the ability.</p>
    <p>Also once per day, the deity can charm plant creatures, animate plants, or make them entangle its foes. This ability functions like the <em>command plants</em> spell, except that its maximum duration is one day no matter which option the deity chooses. At any one time, the deity can charm a number of plant creatures equal to its divine rank with this ability, regardless of Hit Dice.</p>

<div id="control-creatures" class="sf-box">
    <h4>Control Creatures</h4>
    <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> The deity can command some kind of creature as noted in the deity's description. This ability is similar to the <em>dominate monster</em> spell, but it is not a mind-affecting ability (the deity seizes direct control over the creature's body). Each day the deity can attempt to control a number of creature equal to its divine rank. The deity can attempt to take control of that number all at once, or in smaller numbers. All creatures to be affected must be within the deity's line of sight when first affected. Once control is established, distance is not a factor and the deity can maintain control remotely, even across planes and through wards or barriers (except divine shields and warding spells cast by deities of higher rank than the deity using the ability). The subject is allowed a Will save (DC 10 + the deity's rank + the deity's Charisma modifier) to resist and is allowed a new save if the deity commands the subject to do something against its nature.</p>
    <p>At any given time, the deity cannot have more creatures under its control than 10 times its divine rank. If the deity already has the maximum number of creatures under its control, it can still attempt to take control of other creatures, but must first release one or more creatures already under its control.</p>
    <p><strong>Notes:</strong> A deity can have this ability multiple times, choosing a different kind of creature each time.</p>

    <h4>Create Object</h4>
    <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Divine rank 6, Int 29.</p>
    <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> As a full-round action, the deity can create one or more simple, nonmagical objects with a total weight of up to 50 pounds per divine rank, or with a total volume of 10 cubic feet per rank. If the deity uses this ability on a divinely morphic plane or within its own godly realm, double the volume and weight the deity can create. If the deity's realm is located on a divinely morphic plane, triple the volume and weight the deity can create there.</p>
    <p><strong>Notes:</strong> For purposes of this ability, a simple object can have no moving parts more complex than a door hinge and must be composed of a single material. The material can be no more valuable than iron (1 sp per pound). Once created, the objects are permanent and nonmagical. If the deity has the appropriate <em>craft</em> skill, the deity can make a <em>craft</em> check when creating the item to make it a masterwork item.</p>

If the deity's realm is located on a divinely morphic plane, triple the volume and weight the deity can create there.</p>

    <p><strong>Rest:</strong> The deity must convert a considerable amount of its own energy into the object, which can leave the deity impaired. The deity can create an object with a value of up to 100 gp without impairment. For every additional 100 gp of value (or fraction of 100 gp), the deity must rest for 10 minutes. If the deity is creating an item on a divinely morphic plane or within its own godly realm, it can create a 200 gp item without resting. If the deity's realm is located on a divinely morphic plane, it can create a 300 gp item there without having to rest.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>For the deity's bardic abilities that have a range (countersong, <em>fascinate,</em> inspire competence, inspire greatness), that range is a number of miles equal to the deity's divine rank.</li>

    <h4>Divine Blast</h4>

    <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> The deity can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + its Charisma bonus. The ray created can extend up to one mile per rank (the deity chooses the length). Targets the ray strikes take 1d12 points of damage per rank of the deity, plus 1d12 points of damage per point of Charisma bonus the deity has. There is no saving throw, but the deity must make a ranged touch attack to hit a target. The deity can make the ray look, sound, smell, and feel like any-thing it desires. Despite the appearance of the ray, the damage it deals results directly from divine power and is therefore not subject to being reduced by <em>protection from elements</em> and similar magic.</p>
    <p><strong>Notes:</strong> The ray destroys a <em>wall of force, prismatic wall,</em> or <em>prismatic sphere</em> it hits (all layers in a prismatic effect are destroyed). The ray itself is unaffected and can strike a target behind the <em>wall of force</em> or prismatic effect.</p>

    <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Divine rank 16, Int 29, Create Object salient divine ability, Create Greater Object salient divine ability.</p>
    <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> As a full-round action, the deity can create mortal creatures or magic items whose total weight is up to 100 pounds per divine rank, or with a total volume of 20 cubic feet per rank. If the deity uses this ability on a divinely morphic plane or within its own godly realm, double the volume and weight the deity can create. If the deity's realm is located on a divinely morphic plane, triple the volume and weight the deity can create there.</p>
    <p><strong>Notes:</strong> This ability works like the Create Greater Object ability, except as noted below.</p>
    <p>A deity can use this ability to create any kind of creature that does not have a divine rank. The deity can create a creature with class levels, but never with more class levels than the deity has itself or the deity's divine rank, whichever is lower.</p>
    <p><strong>Rest:</strong> The deity must convert a considerable amount of its own energy into a creature, which always leaves the deity impaired. The deity must rest for 10 minutes &#215; the creature's Hit Dice &#215; the creature's Challenge Rating for each creature created, with a minimum of 10 minutes per creature. If the creature has class levels, each level counts as an additional Hit Die.</p>

    <p><strong>Notes:</strong> The ability is similar to the <em>blink</em> spell, except that it is defensive only and the deity does not move to the Ethereal Plane, but simply exits from reality for a brief moment. This ability never interferes with the deity's own attacks. If an attack overcomes the miss chance, the deity still gets the benefit of a saving throw (if one is allowed).</p>

    <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> The deity can enchant creatures to create a specific emotion. The deity can affect one creature per divine rank at once, and up to the same number each day. All must be within the deity's line of sight when first affected. The specific effects depend on the emotional state induced.</p>
    <p><em>Courage:</em> The enchanted creatures become immune to fear effects and receive a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, skill checks, and Will saves.</p>
    <p><em>Despair:</em> The enchanted creatures are affected as by an improved version of the <em>crushing despair</em> spell: affected creatures suffer a -4 penalty on attack rolls, damage rolls, saves, and checks unless they make a successful Will save (DC 10 + deity's Charisma modifier + deity's divine rank). The effect lasts one day.</p>
    <p><em>Dread:</em> The enchanted creatures must make successful Wisdom checks (DC = the deity's divine rank) to attack or fight. If the check fails, the creature flees in panic for 1d4 rounds. If the check succeeds, the creature does not have to check again for 10 minutes. The enchanted creatures also suffer a -2 morale penalty on attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, skill checks, and Will saves.</p>
    <p><em>Frenzy:</em> Frenzied creatures spend themselves in drinking, feasting, and dancing unless provoked or incited to violence. Frenzied creatures turn violent if they are attacked or perceive a threat to their safety. Frenzied creatures receive a +4 morale bonus to Strength and Dexterity, a -4 penalty to Wisdom, and a -2 penalty to AC. Subjects can attempt Will saves (DC 10 + deity's Charisma modifier + deity's divine rank) to resist the effect. This is a mind-affecting compulsion.</p>
    <p><em>Hope:</em> The enchanted creatures gain a +4 morale bonus on saving throws, attack rolls, ability checks, skill checks, and weapon damage rolls.</p>
    <p><em>Rage:</em> The enchanted creatures receive a +4 morale bonus to Strength and Constitution scores, a +2 morale bonus on Will saves, and a -2 penalty to AC. They are compelled to fight heedless of danger. Subjects can attempt Will saves (DC 10 + deity's Charisma modifier + deity's divine rank) to resist the effect. This is a mind-affecting compulsion.</p>
    <p><em>Love and Desire:</em> A love effect causes the target to fall in love with the specified creature, seeking every opportunity to be near that creature and making every effort to win the creature's affection. A desire effect is similar, but the target seeks any opportunity to become physically intimate with the specified creature. Subjects can attempt Will saves (DC 10 + deity's Charisma modifier + deity's divine rank) to resist the effect. This is a mind-affecting compulsion effect.</p>

If the deity chooses, a particular attack can be bludgeoning instead of slashing, but the keen and vorpal qualities do not apply to that attack. Any unarmed attack the deity makes has a base damage of 2d12.</p>
    <p>The deity can use the Deflect Arrows feat to deflect any ranged attacks (including spells that require ranged touch attacks) as if they were arrows. The deity can deflect any number of attacks in a single round. When the deity deflects any attack, the attack is reflected upon the attacker, using the deity's base ranged attack bonus.

Once used, the ability lasts 1 hour (though the deity can end the rage at will). While raging, the deity gains +10 to Strength, +10 to Constitution, and a +5 morale bonus on Will saves. The deity's spell resistance and energy resistances each increase by +10. The deity also can make one extra attack, at its full attack bonus, whenever it uses the full attack action.

    <p>The deity can follow tracks at its normal land speed. It treats all normal terrain as very soft ground for purposes of tracking and ignores DC modifiers for time or weather.

    <h4>Divine Sneak Attack</h4>
    <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Sneak attack +10d6, crippling strike.</p>
    <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> The deity's sneak attacks deal an additional +3d6 points of damage.</p>
    <p>Any attack of opportunity the deity makes is considered a sneak attack.</p>
    <p>The deity can flank or catch flat-footed any opponent whose divine rank does not exceed the deity's and can sneak attack that opponent. The deity cannot deal sneak attack damage to opponents that are immune to critical hits. Any time the deity inflicts damage with a sneak attack, that target suffers damage equal to the deity's sneak attack bonus damage on the deity's next turn as well.</p>

<div id="divine-spell-focus" class="sf-box">
    <h4>Divine Spell Focus</h4>
    <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Spell Focus, Greater Spell Focus.</p>
    <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> The deity chooses one school of magic. The save DC for any spell of that school increases by one-half the deity's divine rank. This bonus overlaps (does not stack with) the bonus from Spell Focus or Greater Spell Focus.</p>
    <p><strong>Notes:</strong> A deity can have this ability multiple times, choosing a different school of magic each time.</p>

<div id="divine-spellcasting" class="sf-box">
    <h4>Divine Spellcasting</h4>
    <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Spellcaster level 20th.</p>
    <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> The deity can cast spells whose effective level is above 9th. The number of spells per day the deity can cast of each spell level above 9th depends on the deity's key ability score for spell-casting classes in which the deity has achieved 20th level, as shown on Table: Divine Spellcasting. The numbers on that table represent one spell per day at each spell level above 9th in which it receives bonus spells from its key ability score, plus bonus spells based on the key ability score. The deity can use these slots for spells prepared or cast with a metamagic feat, or for lower-level spells.</p>
    <p>If the deity has achieved 20th level in a spellcasting class with fewer than nine levels of spells (such as bard, paladin, or ranger), the deity can also cast one spell per day of each level between the maximum normal spell level and 9th, plus appropriate bonus spells of each level based on the deity's key ability score. These spells are not shown on the table.</p>
    <p>The deity also doesn't incur attacks of opportunity for casting spells when threatened.</p>
    <p>In addition, the deity receives the benefit of the Spell Focus feat on any spell it casts.</p>
    <p><strong>Suggested Portfolio Elements:</strong> Magic.</p>
    <h5>Spell Slots Above 9th Level</h5>
    <p>The Divine Spellcasting ability grants deities access to spell slots above 9th level (which can be used to hold lower-level spells or spells whose level has been increased above 9th by the use of metamagic feats). The number of spell slots available to a deity depends on the deity's key ability score (Intelligence for wizards, Wisdom for clerics, druids, paladins, and rangers, and Charisma for bards and sorcerers), as shown on Table: Divine Spellcasting.</p>
    <p>Even though the table only includes ability scores up to 61 and spell slots up to 25th level, the progression continues infinitely in both directions. For ability scores beyond 61, or for spell slots above 25th level, expand the table to follow the same patterns as shown.</p>
    <p>The numbers on this table include bonus spells that a deity receives for having a sufficiently high ability score, as well as one additional spell of each level at which the deity gains at least one bonus spell. This additional spell is one of the benefits of the Divine Spellcasting salient divine ability.</p>

    <h4>Divine Splendor</h4>
    <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Divine rank 16, Cha 26.</p>
    <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Any mortal who approaches within 10 feet per divine rank of the deity in its natural form dies immediately, with no saving throw.</p>
    <p><strong>Suggested Portfolio Elements:</strong> Supreme.</p>
</div>

<div id="divine-storm" class="sf-box">
    <h4>Divine Storm</h4>
    <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Divine rank 11.</p>
    <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> The deity can surround itself with a vortex of holy or unholy force that manifests in different forms depending on the deity. The vortex extends from the deity in an emanation with a radius of 10 feet per divine rank. The effect stops attacks with thrown weapons and projectiles (they fail if made by creatures inside the area, or targeted at creatures within the area, or if their paths take them through the area).</p>
    <p>In addition, the force expels creatures whose alignment on the ethical (lawful-chaotic) axis is opposite the deity's. If the deity's ethical alignment is neutral (neutral good or neutral evil), the force does not expel any creatures. Affected creatures in the area must make Fortitude saves (DC 10 + the deity's Charisma modifier + the deity's divine rank) or be picked up and thrown out, regardless of size. Such creatures suffer 1d6 points of damage for each 10 feet they travel. Creatures that make successful saves are not affected by the vortex for one day, although the vortex still stops their thrown weapons and projectiles. Creatures that fail their saves can attempt to reenter the area, but must attempt new saves.</p>
    <p>The force damages creatures whose alignment on the moral (good-evil) axis is opposite the deity's. If the deity's moral alignment is neutral (lawful neutral or chaotic neutral), the force does not damage any creatures. Affected creatures in the area must make Fortitude saves (DC 10 + the deity's Charisma modifier + the deity's divine rank) each round or suffer 1 point of holy damage per divine rank. A successful save negates the damage, but the creature must save again the next round if it is still within the area.</p>
    <p>Creatures whose alignment is diametrically opposed to the deity's are subject to both effects.</p>

<div id="divine-water-mastery" class="sf-box">
    <h4>Divine Water Mastery</h4>
    <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Water domain.</p>
    <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> The deity gains a competence bonus on attack, damage, and Armor Class equal to its divine rank if both the deity and its foe are touching the same body of water.</p>
    <p>The deity gains a swim speed commensurate with its size (see Divine Characteristics).</p>
    <p>At will, as a full-round action, the deity can create a devastating tidal wave of water. On land, the wave has effects similar to a flash flood: Creatures caught in the water must make a Fortitude save (DC 15). Large or smaller creatures that fail the save are swept away, taking 1d6 points of subdual damage per round (1d3 points on a successful <em>swim</em> check against DC 20). Huge creatures that fail are knocked down, while Gargantuan and Colossal creatures are checked. The wave destroys all wooden buildings and 25% of the stone buildings it comes into contact with. At sea, the tidal wave capsizes ships and crushes them to splinters. The wave affects a number of miles of coastland up to the deity's divine rank.</p>
    <p>When touching water, the deity can automatically sense the location of anything within 10 feet per divine rank that is in contact with the same body of water.</p>

    <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> The deity can create an emanation of a specific type of energy (acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic energy, specified in the deity's description) with a radius of 10 feet per divine rank. Anything in the area takes 1d8 points of the appropriate energy damage per divine rank. Damage is halved for those who make successful saving throws (Reflex for acid, cold, electricity, or fire, or Fortitude for sonic energy; DC 10 + the deity's divine rank + the deity's Constitution modifier).</p>

The vortex extends from the deity in an emanation with a radius of 10 feet per divine rank. The effect stops attacks with thrown weapons and projectiles. Such attacks fail if made by creatures inside the area, or targeted at creatures within the area, or if their paths take them through the area.</p>
    <p>Energy storms that use acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic energy deal 1 point of energy damage and 1 point of holy damage per divine rank each round.</p>
    <p>Positive energy deals 1 point of damage per divine rank to undead creatures, and heals the same amount of damage on living creatures.</p>

It can affect up to one creature per divine rank at once, but no more than one creature per divine rank each day. All must be within the deity's line of sight when first affected. Subjects can attempt Fortitude saves (DC 10 + deity's Charisma modifier + deity's divine rank). Creatures who fail their saves become fatigued and their speed is reduced by half. Furthermore, any mount or vehicle they ride is likewise slowed. The effect lasts one day.</p>

Foes within the burst, but not the deity's immediate target, become shaken for 3d6 rounds if they fail their saves. Creatures the deity attacks when it activates the ability become panicked for 3d6 rounds if they fail their saves. Foes who make successful saving throws are unaffected by this ability for one day.</p>
    <p><strong>Suggested Portfolio Elements:</strong> Destruction, war.</p>

<div id="gift-of-life" class="sf-box">
    <h4>Gift of Life</h4>
    <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> The deity restores the dead creature to life, no matter how long the creature has been dead or what the condition of the body.</p>
    <p><strong>Notes:</strong> This ability works like the <em>true resurrection</em> spell, except that there is no material component and the amount of time the subject has been dead is irrelevant.</p>
    <p>This ability can restore a creature to life against its will, but only with the permission of whatever deity rules the underworld or the divine realm where the mortal's soul resides. This ability can resurrect an elemental or outsider and can resurrect a creature whose soul is trapped, provided the soul is not held by a deity of higher rank than the one using this ability.</p>
    <p>This ability cannot restore life to a creature that has been slain by the Hand of Death ability or the Life and Death ability of a deity with a higher rank.</p>
    <p><strong>Suggested Portfolio Elements:</strong> Healing, life.</p>
</div>

<div id="grow-creature" class="sf-box">
    <h4>Grow Creature</h4>
    <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> This ability works like the <em>animal growth</em> spell, except that it can affect up to one creature of the specified type per divine rank each day, all of which must be within the deity's line of sight when first affected. The effect lasts one day.</p>

    <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> The deity points to any mortal within the deity's sensory range and snuffs out its life. There must be an unbroken line of effect between the deity and the target.</p>
    <p><strong>Notes:</strong> This ability works like the <em>destruction</em> spell, except that there is no material component. The mortal is allowed a Fortitude saving throw with a DC of 20 + the deity's Charisma bonus + the deity's divine rank. Even if the save succeeds, the subject takes 10d6 points of damage, which may kill it anyway. If the attack kills the mortal (either through a failed saving throw or through damage), the mortal cannot be raised or resurrected afterward, except by a deity of equal or higher rank using the Gift of Life, Life and Death, or Mass Life and Death salient divine ability.</p>

<div id="increased-damage-reduction" class="sf-box">
    <h4>Increased Damage Reduction</h4>
    <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Con 29.
    <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> The deity's damage reduction increases 5 and adds an alignment requirement opposed to the deity's alignment to bypass the damage reduction. For example, a lawful good deity with DR25/epic would gain DR 30/epic and evil or DR 30 epic and chaotic.</p>
    <p><strong>Notes:</strong> A deity cannot chose this ability more than once.</p>

<div id="instant-counterspell" class="sf-box">
    <h4>Instant Counterspell</h4>
    <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> When any spell is cast within the deity's line of sight, the deity can counterspell it as a free action, provided that the deity is capable of casting the spell immediately or has it as a spell-like ability and makes the required <em>spellcraft</em> check. The use of Instant Counterspell counts against the normal number of free actions the deity is allowed each round.</p>

<div id="instant-move" class="sf-box">
    <h4>Instant Move</h4>

    <h4>Irresistible Blows</h4>
    <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Weapon Focus and Improved Critical with the selected melee weapon.</p>
    <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> When the deity makes a melee attack with the chosen weapon against a creature, resolve the attack as a melee touch attack (the weapon blow ignores armor and natural armor bonuses). If the weapon hits, the creature struck must make a Fortitude save (DC 10 + the deity's Constitution modifier + the deity's divine rank) or be stunned for 1d10 rounds.</p>
    <p>The deity's attacks with the chosen weapons are considered to be adamantine for purposes of bypassing damage reduction and hardness.</p>
    <p><strong>Notes:</strong> A deity can have this ability multiple times, choosing a different kind of weapon each time.</p>

<div id="irresistible-performance" class="sf-box">
    <h4>Irresistible Performance</h4>
    <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> <em>perform</em> 40 ranks.</p>
    <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> When the deity sings, plays a musical instrument, tells jokes, recites verse, or engages in any other type of performance as a full-round action, the deity has the option to create any of the following effects. The deity can use this ability a number of times per day equal to its divine rank. It affects up to one creature per divine rank within a burst with a radius of 10 feet per divine rank, centered on the deity.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Affected creatures become unable to take actions; instead, they dance, observe the performance with rapt attention, laugh, or applaud at the deity's option. The affected creatures also suffer a -4 penalty to Armor Class, cannot succeed at Reflex saves (except on a roll of 20), and cannot use shields. Creatures can resist this mind effect with a successful Will save (DC 10 + the deity's Charisma modifier + the deity's divine rank). The effects last for as long as the deity performs and for up to 1 round per divine rank thereafter.</li>
        <li>Affected creatures become blissfully calm. They are immune to fear and compulsion effects except for those created by deities of higher rank than the performing deity and any such effects already operating on affected creatures are countered and dispelled. This ability also counters and dispels rage effects except for those created by deities of higher rank than the performing deity. Immunity to fear and compulsion last for as long as the deity performs and for up to 1 round per divine rank thereafter.</li>
        <li>Affected creatures fall asleep. This works like the <em>sleep</em> spell, except that any living creature can be affected. Creatures can resist this mind effect with Will saves (DC 10 + the deity's Charisma modifier + the deity's divine rank). Affected creatures sleep for up to 1 hour per divine rank or until awakened. The deity can end the effect at will.</li>
        <li>Affected creatures are so deeply moved that they simply die. Only living creatures with Hit Dice equal to or less than the deity's divine rank are affected. Creatures can resist the effect with Fortitude saves (DC 10 + the deity's Charisma modifier + the deity's divine rank).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Once a creature makes a successful save against one of the deity's performances, the creature cannot be affected again for one day.</p>
    <p>Note: Not all deities with this ability can create all the mentioned effects, as specified in the deity descriptions.</p>

</div>

<div id="know-secrets" class="sf-box">
    <h4>Know Secrets</h4>
    <p>No secrets can be kept from the deity.</p>
    <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> The deity can learn a creature's entire history (including any embarrassing or vital secrets it might know) just by looking at it. This ability is similar to the <em>legend lore</em> spell, except that it delivers instant results and the subject is allowed a Will save (DC 10 + the deity's Charisma modifier + the deity's divine rank) to avoid the effect.</p>
    <p><strong>Suggested Portfolio Elements:</strong> Knowledge, secrets.</p>
</div>

<div id="lay-curse" class="sf-box">
    <h4>Lay Curse</h4>
    <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> This ability works like the <em>bestow curse</em> spell, except that mortals get no save. Deities of equal or lesser rank are subject to this ability, but are allowed Will saves (DC 10 + the deity's Charisma modifier + the deity's divine rank) to resist. The curse can be removed only by a deity of equal or higher rank than the cursing deity.</p>
    <p>The deity can affect up to one creature per divine rank at once, but no more than that number each day. All must be within the deity's line of sight when first affected.</p>
    <p><strong>Suggested Portfolio Elements:</strong> Evil.</p>

<div id="lay-quest" class="sf-box">
    <h4>Lay Quest</h4>
    <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> This ability works like the <em>geas/quest</em> spell, except that it works only on mortals and it can be removed only by a deity of equal or higher rank than the deity who lays the quest. The deity can affect up to one creature per divine rank at once, but no more than that number each day. All must be within the deity's line of sight when first affected.</p>

<div id="life-and-death" class="sf-box">
    <h4>Life and Death</h4>
    <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Divine rank 6, Gift of Life or Hand of Death salient divine ability.</p>
    <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> The deity designates any mortal and snuffs out its life. Or the deity can designate any dead mortal and restore it to life.</p>
    <p><strong>Notes:</strong> This ability works across planar boundaries and penetrates any barrier except a divine shield. However, the subject must be in a location the deity can sense, either within the deity's sense range or in a location the deity can perceive through its remote sensing ability. If the deity cannot see the subject, the deity must unambiguously identify the subject in some fashion. If the deity chooses to kill a mortal, the ability works like the <em>destruction</em> spell, except that there is no material component or saving throw. The mortal cannot be raised or resurrected afterward, except by a deity of equal or higher rank using the Gift of Life or Life and Death salient divine ability.</p>
    <p>If the deity restores life to a mortal, this ability works like the <em>true resurrection</em> spell, except that there is no material component and the amount of time the subject has been dead is irrelevant.</p>
    <p>This ability cannot restore a creature to life against its will, but it can resurrect an elemental or outsider. It can resurrect a creature whose soul is trapped, provided the soul is not held by a deity of higher rank than the one using this ability.</p>
    <p>This ability cannot restore life to a creature that has been slain by the Hand of Death, Life and Death, or Mass Life and Death ability of a deity with a higher rank.</p>
    <p><strong>Rest:</strong> After using either version of this ability, the deity must rest for 1 minute per level or Hit Die of the creature affected.</p>
    <p>Deities whose portfolio includes death do not have to rest after using this ability.</p>

<div id="life-drain" class="sf-box">
    <h4>Life Drain</h4>
    <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Death domain.</p>
    <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> As a free action, the deity can generate a cloud of darkness that rises from its body in a spread with a radius of 10 feet per divine rank and 10 feet high. The cloud blocks sight as a <em>deeper darkness</em> spell does, except that it cannot be countered by light effects (other than those cast by deities of higher rank). Living creatures must make Will saves (DC 10 + the deity's Charisma modifier + the deity's divine rank) or die. Even with a successful save, living creatures still gain two negative levels (the save DC to remove the negative levels is the same as the first Will save). A single creature can be drained by the cloud only once per day, but the cloud's darkness remains effective.</p>
    <p><strong>Suggested Portfolio Elements:</strong> Death, undead.</p>

    <h4>Mass Divine Blast</h4>
    <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Divine rank 6, Cha 29, Divine Blast salient divine ability.</p>
    <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> This ability works like the Divine Blast ability, except that the deity can specify up to five targets per rank, no two of which can be more than one mile apart per rank, or an area. The area can be a cone, burst, spread, or cylinder. A cone can be up to 100 feet long per rank. A burst or spread can have a radius of up to 50 feet per rank. A cylinder can have a radius of up to 50 feet per rank and a height of up to 10 feet per rank. The deity chooses the attack's exact form and dimensions.</p>
    <p>Each use of this ability counts as a use of the deity's Divine Blast ability.</p>
    <p><strong>Suggested Portfolio Elements:</strong> Death, destruction, war.</p>

<div id="mass-life-and-death" class="sf-box">
    <h4>Mass Life and Death</h4>
    <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Divine rank 16, Gift of Life or Hand of Death salient divine ability, Life and Death salient divine ability.</p>
    <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> The deity can designate any number of mortals and snuffs out their lives. Or the deity can designate any number of dead mortals and restore them to life.</p>
    <p><strong>Notes:</strong> No two mortals affected by a single use of this ability can be more than one mile apart per rank of the deity. The ability is otherwise identical with the Life and Death salient divine ability.</p>
    <p><strong>Rest:</strong> After using either version of this ability, the deity must rest for 1 minute per levels or Hit Dice of the creatures affected.</p>

<div id="master-crafter" class="sf-box">
    <h4>Master Crafter</h4>
    <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> 23 ranks in two different <em>craft</em> skills.</p>
    <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Any object the deity creates is treated as a masterwork item, but uses the base item price (not the masterwork price) to determine time and cost required to create it. Any item the deity creates also has twice the hit points it would normally have, and its break DC is increased by +10. These benefits apply to walls, doors, and other components of buildings the deity creates, as well as smaller items.</p>
    <p><strong>Suggested Portfolio Elements:</strong> Crafts, creation.</p>
</div>

<div id="mind-of-the-beast" class="sf-box">
    <h4>Mind of the Beast</h4>
    <p>The deity can make plants and animals sentient, and it can reduce sentient creatures to animal or plant form.</p>
    <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> The deity can grant humanlike sentience to trees or animals. This sentience lasts a maximum of one day, and the sentient tree or animal obeys the deity's commands to the best of its ability. The deity can affect up to one creature per divine rank at once, but no more than that number each day. All must be within the deity's line of sight when first affected.</p>
    <p>Also, the deity can transmute any creature into a plant or animal of approximately the same size or up to two size categories smaller. The subject is allowed a Fortitude save (DC 10 + the deity's Charisma modifier + the deity's divine rank) to resist. Subjects turned into plants become objects. Subjects turned into animals have the same abilities and statistics of the kind of animal the deity chooses.</p>
    <p>The Alter Reality ability can make either effect permanent.</p>
    <p><strong>Suggested Portfolio Elements:</strong> Nature.</p>
</div>

<div id="possess-mortal" class="sf-box">
    <h4>Possess Mortal</h4>
    <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Cha 29.</p>
    <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> The deity can possess any mortal in any location the deity can sense. Unwilling mortals can attempt Will saves (DC 10 + the deity's Charisma modifier + the deity's rank).</p>
    <p><strong>Notes:</strong> Spells that prevent possession block this ability if the mortal is unwilling. Likewise, spells that end possession drive out the deity if the mortal is unwilling. If the mortal is willing, however, the deity cannot be blocked or driven out, except by a divine shield or the use of the Alter Reality salient divine ability by a deity of higher rank.</p>
    <p>The possessed mortal effectively becomes an avatar of the deity. The deity can draw on all the possessed mortal's memories, and the deity senses what the mortal senses. Each mortal possessed counts as a remote location where the deity is sensing and communicating. A demigod can possess up to two mortals at a time, a lesser deity can possess up to five mortals at once, an intermediate deity can possess up to ten, and a greater deity can possess up to twenty mortals at once.</p>
    <p>While the deity is in possession, the mortal's abilities are unchanged, except as noted below.</p>
    <p><em>Type:</em> Same as the deity.</p>
    <p><em>Hit Points:</em> Same as the mortal, +1 for each rank of the deity.</p>
    <p><em>Armor Class</em>: The mortal gains a divine bonus to Armor Class equal to half the deity's divine rank.</p>
    <p><em>Ability Scores:</em> Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution are unchanged. Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma become 5 points lower than the deity's (or remain as the mortal's scores if they are higher).</p>
    <p><em>Saves:</em> Fortitude and Reflex same as the mortal; Will adjusted if necessary for the mortal's new Wisdom score.</p>
    <p><em>Skills:</em> The mortal can use its own skills and the deity's skills. If the mortal and the deity have the same skill, use the skill of whichever has more ranks in the skill. Use the mortal's effective ability scores to determine skill modifiers.</p>

All must be within the deity's line of sight when first affected. Subjects receive a luck bonus of +1 per divine rank or a luck penalty of -1 per divine rank on attack rolls, saves, and checks for one day. Any creature that attacks the deity automatically suffers the luck penalty, and this does not count against the deity's daily uses of this ability.</p>

<div id="power-of-nature" class="sf-box">
    <h4>Power of Nature</h4>

    <p><strong>Suggested Portfolio Elements:</strong> Nature, sea, weather.</p>

<div id="power-of-truth" class="sf-box">
    <h4>Power of Truth</h4>
    <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> The deity knows when anyone (other than a deity of equal or higher rank) deliberately lies. This ability works like the <em>discern lies</em> spell, except that it works continuously and applies to any creature the deity can perceive. The deity also can enchant creatures so they become truthful. The deity can affect up to one creature per divine rank at once, but no more than that number each day. All must be within the deity's line of sight when first affected. The enchanted creatures become unable to utter any deliberate falsehoods or evasions of truth for one day. The subject is allowed a Will save (DC 10 + the deity's Charisma modifier + the deity's divine rank) to resist. Subjects who make successful saves become immune to this ability for one day.</p>

<div id="rejuvenation" class="sf-box">
    <h4>Rejuvenation</h4>
    <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Divine rank 11, Divine Fast Healing salient divine ability.</p>
    <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> When the deity suffers an attack that should destroy it, it simply disperses and reassembles later. Roll 10d10 to determine the number of days before the deity returns.</p>
    <p><strong>Notes:</strong> If the deity is killed in its own realm, subtract the deity's divine rank from the number of days it takes to return. If the deity's realm is on a divinely morphic Outer Plane, and the deity is killed there, subtract twice the deity's divine rank from the number of days it takes to return. The return always takes at least one day.</p>
    <p>This ability is ineffective if the deity is killed by another deity of equal or higher rank.</p>
    <p><strong>Suggested Portfolio Elements:</strong> Death, life, undead.</p>
</div>

<div id="see-magic" class="sf-box">
    <h4>See Magic</h4>
    <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Magic domain.</p>
    <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> This ability is similar to a constant <em>greater arcane sight</em> spell, except that it covers the whole area the deity can see, and the deity immediately knows the number of auras present along with their locations and strengths. The deity needs to make a <em>spellcraft</em> check to identify the school of each aura, but most deities with this ability can use Spellcraft as a free action.</p>
    <p><strong>Suggested Portfolio Elements:</strong> Magic.</p>

<div id="shapechange" class="sf-box">
    <h4>Shapechange</h4>
    <p>This is an extraordinary ability.</p>
    <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Divine rank 11, Alter Size salient divine ability, Alter Form salient divine ability.</p>
    <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> The deity can assume the form of an animal, beast, dragon, fey, giant, humanoid, magical beast, monstrous humanoid, or plant. The assumed form must be both living and corporeal. The deity can remain in the assumed form indefinitely, but it resumes its own form if slain.</p>
    <p><strong>Notes:</strong> This ability works like the Shift Form salient divine ability, except that the deity is not limited to a set number of forms and as noted here.</p>
    <p>The deity can use its Alter Size ability simultaneously with this one to become as small as a grain of sand or as large as 1,600 feet in the assumed form's greatest dimension.</p>
    <p>The deity can use this ability to create disguises, gaining a bonus of +20 on its <em>disguise</em> checks.</p>
    <p><strong>Suggested Portfolio Elements:</strong> Nature, secrets, thieves.</p>
</div>

<div id="shift-form" class="sf-box">
    <h4>Shift Form</h4>
    <p>This is an extraordinary ability.</p>
    <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Divine rank 6, Alter Size salient divine ability, Alter Form salient divine ability.</p>
    <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> The deity can assume the form of another creature. The forms a deity can assume are limited and vary with each deity. The forms allowed are listed in the deity's description. The deity can remain in the assumed form indefinitely, but it resumes its own form if slain.</p>
    <p><strong>Notes:</strong> The deity acquires the physical, natural, and extraordinary abilities of the form it has assumed (but not spell-like or supernatural abilities) while retaining its own mind. Physical abilities include natural size and Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores. Natural abilities include armor, natural weapons (such as claws, bite, swoop and rake, and constriction; but not petrification, breath weapons, energy drain, energy effect, and the like), and similar gross physical qualities (presence or absence of wings, number of extremities, and so on). A body with extra limbs does not allow the deity to make more attacks (or more advantageous two-weapon attacks) than normal. Natural abilities also include mundane movement capabilities, such as walking, swimming, and flight with wings. The deity's speed is that of the assumed form or the deity's normal speed, whichever is higher.</p>
    <p>In general, any part of the body or piece of equipment that is separated from the whole reverts to its original form. However, if the assumed form has an extraordinary ability that allows it to produce a substance or shed part of its body, then this ability also grants that ability.</p>
    <p>The deity retains its Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, level and class, hit points (despite any change in its Constitution score), alignment, base attack bonus, and base saves. (New Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores may affect final attack and save bonuses.) The deity retains its outsider type, extraordinary abilities, spells, and spell-like abilities, but not its supernatural abilities.</p>
    <p>The deity also retains its divine Armor Class bonus and divine qualities and abilities, provided they are not supernatural.</p>
    <p>The deity can cast spells for which it has components. It needs a voice like that of a humanoid for verbal components and hands like those of a humanoid for somatic components, Likewise, the deity needs hands to use many of its powers, such as creating objects related to its portfolio.</p>
    <p>When the shape shift occurs, the deity's equipment, if any, transforms to match the new form. If the new form is a creature that does not use equipment (aberration, animal, beast, magical beast, construct, dragon, elemental, ooze, some outsiders, plant, some undead creatures, some shapechangers, or vermin), the equipment melds into the new form and becomes nonfunctional.</p>
    <p>Material components and focuses melded in this way cannot be used to cast spells. If the new form uses equipment (fey, giant, humanoid, some outsiders, many shapechangers, many undead creatures), the deity's equipment changes to match the new form and retains its properties.</p>
    <p>This ability cannot confer class levels or class abilities.</p>
    <p>The deity can change physical qualities such as hair color, hair texture, skin color, and gender. The deity can use this ability to create disguises, gaining a bonus of +15 on its <em>disguise</em> checks.</p>
    <p>The deity can use its Alter Size ability simultaneously with this one to become as small as a grain of sand or as large as 1,600 feet in the assumed form's greatest dimension.</p>

</div>

<div id="speak-with-creatures" class="sf-box">
    <h4>Speak with Creatures</h4>
    <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> The deity has the supernatural ability to converse with the specified creature. This ability works like a permanent <em>speak with animals</em> or <em>speak with plants</em> spell, or like a <em>tongues</em> spell that only allows the deity to converse with the specified type of creature.</p>
    <p><strong>Notes:</strong> A deity can have this ability multiple times, choosing a different type of creature each time.</p>

    <h4>Spontaneous Wizard Spells</h4>
    <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Divine rank 6, Wizard level 1st, Int 29, Spell Mastery, Arcane Mastery salient divine ability.</p>
    <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> This ability works like a cleric's ability to cast <em>cure</em> spells spontaneously, except that it applies to wizard spells. The deity must have a sufficient Intelligence score and wizard levels to cast the spell.</p>
    <p><strong>Notes:</strong> The deity still needs a spellbook for its wizard spells unless it also has the Divine Spellcasting ability.</p>
    <p><strong>Suggested Portfolio Elements:</strong> Knowledge, magic.</p>

<div id="stride" class="sf-box">
    <h4>Stride</h4>
    <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Travel domain.</p>
    <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> The deity's movement is doubled on the local or overland scales. Also, having this ability means that the deity's height does not limit the distance it can jump.</p>
    <p>In addition, the deity can impart extra overland speed to living creatures. The deity can affect up to one creature per divine rank at once, but no more than that number each day. All must be within the deity's line of sight when first affected. Creatures who receive this boon double their speeds on the local or overland scales.</p>

<div id="sunder-and-disjoin" class="sf-box">
    <h4>Sunder and Disjoin</h4>
    <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> If any weapon or item is used against the deity in combat, the deity can destroy it with a touch. Treat a successful touch as a combination of a <em>disintegrate</em> spell and a  <em>disjunction</em> spell, both targeted exclusively at the touched item. The save DC for both effects is 19 + the deity's Charisma modifier. Anitem remains vulnerable to this ability for up to one day after being used against the deity.</p>

<div id="supreme-initiative" class="sf-box">
    <h4>Supreme Initiative</h4>
    <p>This is an extraordinary ability.</p>
    <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Dex 29, Improved Initiative.</p>
    <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> The deity goes first in the initiative order, no matter what its initiative result is or what initiative result anyone else in an encounter or battle has.</p>
    <p><strong>Notes:</strong> Determine initiative normally among any beings who don't have this ability, placing them in order after the deity. The deity can choose to delay or ready an action, just any other being can, and doing so changes the deity's initiative as normal. The deity also can refocus, thereby resuming its position at the beginning of the initiative order.</p>
    <p>If two or more deities who have this ability are in the same battle, the deity with the highest divine rank gets the first position in the initiative order, the deity with the second highest rank gets the second position, and so on. Other beings then go in order after the last deity with the Supreme Initiative ability.</p>
    <p>If two deities with this ability and the same divine rank are in a battle, make an initiative check for each deity, and the deity with the higher result goes first.</p>

The deity can use <em>legend lore</em> and <em>analyze dweomer</em> as free actions at will. These actions count against the deity's maximum number of free actions per round.</p>

    <h4>True Shapechange</h4>
    <p>This is an extraordinary ability.</p>
    <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Divine rank 16, Alter Size salient divine ability, Alter Form salient divine ability, Shapechange salient divine ability.</p>
    <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> The deity can assume the form of any object or creature. The deity can remain in the assumed form indefinitely, but it resumes its own form if slain.</p>
    <p><strong>Notes:</strong> This ability works like the Shift Form salient divine ability, except as noted below.</p>
    <p>The deity can take any form, living or unliving, corporal or incorporeal. The deity gains the supernatural abilities of the assumed form.</p>
    <p>The deity can use this ability to create disguises, gaining a bonus of +20 on its <em>disguise</em> checks.</p>
    <p>The deity can use its Alter Size ability simultaneously with this one to become as small as a grain of sand or as large as 1,600 feet in the assumed form's greatest dimension.</p>
    <p><strong>Suggested Portfolio Elements:</strong> Nature, secrets, thieves.</p>
</div>

<div id="undead-mastery" class="sf-box">
    <h4>Undead Mastery</h4>
    <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Divine rank 14, Cleric level 17th.</p>
    <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> The deity can automatically command or destroy any undead creature, as desired, as a free action, though this counts against the normal limit of free actions per round. The deity can do this as often as desired, but it can command no more than one undead creature per divine rank (regardless of the creatures' Hit Dice) at any one time.</p>
    <p><strong>Suggested Portfolio Elements:</strong> Death, life, undead.</p>
</div>

<div id="undead-qualities" class="sf-box">
    <h4>Undead Qualities</h4>
    <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> The deity gains the qualities of the undead type:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>No Constitution score.</li>
        <li>Darkvision out to 60 feet.</li>
        <li>Immunity to all mind-affecting effects (charms, compulsions, phantasms, patterns, and morale effects).</li>
        <li>Immunity to poison, sleep effects, paralysis, stunning, disease, and death effects.</li>
        <li>Not subject to critical hits, nonlethal damage, ability drain, or energy drain. Immune to damage to its physical ability scores (Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution), as well as to fatigue and exhaustion effects.</li>
        <li>Cannot heal damage on its own if it has no Intelligence score, although it can be healed. Negative energy can heal undead creatures. The fast healing special quality works regardless of the creature's Intelligence score.</li>
        <li>Immunity to any effect that requires a Fortitude save (unless the effect also works on objects or is harmless).</li>
        <li>Uses its Charisma modifier for <em>concentration</em> checks.</li>
        <li>Not at risk of death from massive damage, but when reduced to 0 hit points or less, it is immediately destroyed.</li>
        <li>Not affected by <em>raise dead</em> and <em>reincarnate</em> spells or abilities. <em>Resurrection</em> and <em>true resurrection</em> can affect undead creatures. These spells turn undead creatures back into the living creatures they were before becoming undead.</li>
        <li>Undead do not breathe, eat, or sleep.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Suggested Portfolio Elements:</strong> Death, undead.</p>

<div id="wave-of-chaos" class="sf-box">
    <h4>Wave of Chaos</h4>
    <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Chaotic alignment.</p>
    <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> The deity can create a wave of mental force that extends from the deity in a spread with a radius of 10 feet per divine rank. Creatures within the spread must make Will saves (DC 10 + the deity's Charisma modifier + the deity's divine rank) or be forced to act unpredictably. This ability works like a <em>confusion</em> spell cast by a sorcerer of level 10 + the deity's divine rank.</p>
    <p><strong>Suggested Portfolio Elements:</strong> Chaos.</p>
</div>

<div id="wound-enemy" class="sf-box">
    <h4>Wound Enemy</h4>
    <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Base attack bonus +20.</p>
    <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> The affected weapon deals damage to a creature such that a wound it causes deals 1d6 points of damage per round thereafter in addition to the normal damage from the weapon. Multiple wounds from the weapon result in cumulative bleeding loss (two wounds for 2d6 points of damage per round, and so on). The bleeding can only be stopped by a successful <em>heal</em> check (DC 15 + the deity's rank) or the application of any <em>cure</em> spell or other healing spell <em>(heal, healing circle,</em> and so on).</p>
    <p><strong>Notes:</strong> The ability functions only when the deity personally attacks with a physical weapon. The ability works with a ranged weapon, but not if someone else uses the weapon. The deity can apply to the ability to any weapon or natural weapon, but not to a spell, spell-like ability, supernatural ability, or divine ability. A deity can have this ability multiple times, and its effects stack.</p>
    <p><strong>Suggested Portfolio Elements:</strong> Death, pain, war.</p>
