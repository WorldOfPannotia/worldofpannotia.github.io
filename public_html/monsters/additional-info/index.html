        <h3 id="improving-monsters">Improving Monsters</h3>
<p>Each of the monster entries describes a typical creature of its kind. However, there are several methods by which extraordinary or unique monsters can be created using a typical creature as the foundation: by adding character classes, increasing a monster's Hit Dice, or by adding a template to a monster. These methods are not mutually exclusive &ndash; it's possible for a monster with a template to be improved by both increasing its Hit Dice and adding character class levels.</p>
<p><strong>Class Levels:</strong> Intelligent creatures that are reasonably humanoid in shape most commonly advance by adding class levels. Creatures that fall into this category have an entry of "By character class" in their Advancement line. When a monster adds a class level, that level usually represents an increase in experience and learned skills and capabilities.</p>
<p><strong>Increased Hit Dice:</strong> Intelligent creatures that are not humanoid in shape, and nonintelligent monsters, can advance by increasing their Hit Dice. Creatures with increased Hit Dice are usually superior specimens of their race, bigger and more powerful than their run-of-the-mill fellows.</p>
<p><strong>Templates:</strong> Both intelligent and nonintelligent creatures with an unusual heritage or an inflicted change in their essential nature may be modified with a template. Templates usually result in tougher monsters with capabilities that differ from those of their common kin.</p>
<p>Each of these three methods for improving monsters is discussed in more detail below.</p>

<h4 id="ability-score-arrays">Ability Score Arrays</h4>
<p>Monsters are assumed to have completely average (or standard) ability scores &ndash; a 10 or an 11 in each ability, as modified by their racial bonuses. However, improved monsters are individuals and often have better than normal ability scores, and usually make use of either the elite array or the nonelite array of ability scores. Monsters who improve by adding a template, and monsters who improve by increasing their Hit Dice, may use any of the three arrays (standard, nonelite, or elite). Any monster unique enough to be improved could easily be considered elite.</p>
<p><strong>Elite Array:</strong> The elite array is 15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8. While the monster has one weakness compared to a typical member of its race, it is significantly better overall. The elite array is most appropriate for monsters who add levels in a player character class.</p>
<p><strong>Nonelite Array:</strong> The nonelite array is 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8. The nonelite array does not necessarily make a monster better than normal, but it does customize the monster as an individual with strengths and weaknesses compared to a typical member of its race. The nonelite array is most appropriate for monsters who add class levels in a NPC class.</p>
<p><strong>Ability Score Improvement:</strong> Treat monster Hit Dice the same as character level for determining ability score increases. This only applies to Hit Dice increases, monsters do not gain ability score increases for levels they "already reached" with their racial Hit Dice, since these adjustments are included in their basic ability scores.</p>

<h4 id="monsters-and-class-levels">Monsters and Class Levels</h4>
<p>If a creature acquires a character class, it follows the rules for multiclass characters.</p>
<p>The creature's Hit Dice equal the number of class levels it has plus its racial Hit Dice. A creature's "monster class" is always a favored class, and the creature never takes XP penalties for having it. Additional Hit Dice gained from taking levels in a character class never affect a creature's size.</p>
<p><strong>Humanoids and Class Levels:</strong> Creatures with 1 or less HD replace their monster levels with their character levels. The monster loses the attack bonus, saving throw bonuses, skills, and feats granted by its 1 monster HD and gains the attack bonus, save bonuses, skills, feats, and other class abilities of a 1st-level character of the appropriate class.</p>
<p><strong>Level Adjustment and Effective Character Level:</strong> To determine the effective character level (ECL) of a monster character, add its level adjustment to its racial Hit Dice and character class levels. The monster is considered to have experience points equal to the minimum needed to be a character of its ECL.</p>
<p>If you choose to equip a monster with gear, use its ECL as its character level for purposes of determining how much equipment it can purchase. Generally, only monsters with an Advancement entry of "By character class" receive NPC gear; other creatures adding character levels should be treated as monsters of the appropriate CR and assigned treasure, not equipment.</p>
<p><strong>Feat Acquisition and Ability Score Increases:</strong> A monster's total Hit Dice, not its ECL, govern its acquisition of feats and ability score increases.</p>

<h4 id="increasing-hit-dice">Increasing Hit Dice</h4>
<p>As its Hit Dice increase, a creature's attack bonuses and saving throw modifiers might improve. It gains more feats and skills, depending on its type, as shown on Table: Creature Improvement by Type.</p>
<p>Note that if a creature acquires a character class, it improves according to its class, not its type.</p>

<h4 id="size-increases">Size Increases</h4>
<p>A creature may become larger when its Hit Dice are increased (the new size is noted parenthetically in the monster's Advancement entry).</p>

<h4 id="templates">Templates</h4>
<p>Certain creatures are created by adding a template to an existing creature. A templated creature can represent a freak of nature, the individual creation of a single experimenter, or the first generation of offspring from parents of different species.</p>

<h5 id="acquired-inherited-templates">Acquired and Inherited Templates</h5>
<p>Some templates can be added to creatures anytime. Templates such as these are referred to as acquired templates, indicating that the creature did not always have the attributes of the template.</p>
<p>Other templates, known as inherited templates, are part of a creature from the beginning of its existence. Creatures are born with these templates.</p>
<p>It's possible for a certain kind of template to be of either type.</p>

<h5 id="reading-a-template">Reading a Template</h5>
<p>A template's description provides a set of instructions for altering an existing creature, known as the base creature. The changes that a template might cause to each line of a creature 's statistics block are discussed below. Generally, if a template does not cause a change to a certain statistic, that entry is missing from the template description. For clarity, the entry for a statistic or attribute that is not changed is sometimes given as "Same as the base creature."</p>
<p><strong>Size and Type:</strong> Templates often change a creature's type, and may change the creature's size.</p>
<p>If a template changes the base creature's type, the creature also acquires the augmented subtype unless the template description indicates otherwise. The augmented subtype is always paired with the creature's original type. Unless a template indicates otherwise, the new creature has the traits of the new type but the features of the original type.</p>
<p>If a template changes a creature's size, use Table: Changes to Statistics by Size to calculate changes to natural armor, Armor Class, attack rolls, and grapple bonus.</p>
<p><strong>Hit Dice and Hit Points:</strong> Most templates do not change the number of Hit Dice a monster has, but some do. Some templates change the size of a creature's Hit Dice (usually by changing the creature type). A few templates change previously acquired Hit Dice, and continue to change Hit Dice gained with class levels, but most templates that change Hit Dice change only the creature's original HD and leave class Hit Dice unchanged.</p>
<p>If the Hit Dice entry in a template description is missing, Hit Dice and hit points do not change unless the creature's Constitution modifier changes.</p>
<p><strong>Initiative:</strong> If a template changes the monster's Dexterity, or if it adds or removes the Improved Initiative feat, this entry changes.</p>
<p><strong>Speed:</strong> If a template modifies a creature's speed, the template states how that happens. More commonly, a template adds a new movement mode.</p>
<p><strong>Armor Class:</strong> If a template changes the creature's size, see Table: Changes to Statistics by Size to determine its new Armor Class and to see whether its natural armor changes. In some cases the method of determining Armor Class changes radically; the template description explains how to adjust the creature's AC.</p>
<p><strong>Base Attack/Grapple:</strong> Templates usually do not change a creature's base attack bonus. If a template modifies a creature's base attack bonus, the template description states how that happens. Changes to a creature's Strength score can change a creature's grapple bonus, as can changes to its size.</p>
<p><strong>Attack and Full Attack:</strong> Most templates do not change a creature's attack bonus or modes of attack, even when the creature's type changes (the creature's base attack bonus is the same as a creature of the original type). Of course, any change in ability scores may affect attack bonuses. If Strength or Dexterity changes, use the new modifier to determine attack bonuses. A change in a monster's size also changes its attack bonus; see Table: Changes to Statistics by Size.</p>
<p><strong>Damage:</strong> Damage changes with Strength. If the creature uses a two-handed weapon or has a single natural weapon, it adds 1-1/2 times its Strength bonus to the damage. If it has more than a single attack then it adds its Strength bonus to damage rolls for the primary attack and 1/2 its Strength bonus to all secondary attacks.</p>
<p><strong>Space/Reach:</strong> A template may change this entry if it changes the monster's size. Note that this table does not take into account special situations such as exceptional reach.</p>
<p><strong>Special Attacks:</strong> A template may add or remove special attacks. The template description gives the details of any special attacks a template provides, including how to determine saving throw DCs, if applicable.</p>
<p><strong>Special Qualities:</strong> A template may add or remove special qualities. The template description gives the details of any special qualities a template provides, including how to determine saving throw DCs, if applicable. Even if the special qualities entry is missing from a template description, the creature still gains any qualities associated with its new type.</p>
<p><strong>Base Saves:</strong> As with attacks, changing a monster's type does not always change its base saving throw bonuses. You only need to adjust them for new modifiers for Constitution, Dexterity, or Wisdom. A template may, however, state that a monster has a different "good" saving throw.</p>
<p><strong>Abilities:</strong> If a template changes one or more ability scores, these changes are noted here.</p>
<p><strong>Skills:</strong> As with attacks, changing a monster's type does not always change its skill points. Most templates don't change the number of Hit Dice a creature has, so you don't need to adjust skills in that case unless the key abilities for those skills have changed, or the template gives a bonus on one or more skills, or unless the template gives a feat that provides a bonus on a skill check.</p>
<p>Some templates change how skill points are determined, but this change usually only affects skill points gained after the template is applied. Treat skills listed in the base creature's description as class skills, as well as any new skills provided by the template.</p>
<p><strong>Feats:</strong> Since most templates do not change the number of Hit Dice a creature has, a template will not change the number of feats the creature has. Some templates grant one or more bonus feats.</p>
<p><strong>Environment:</strong> Usually the same as the base creature.</p>
<p><strong>Organization:</strong> Usually the same as the base creature.</p>
<p><strong>Challenge Rating:</strong> Most templates increase the creature's Challenge Rating. A template might provide a modifier to be added to the base creature's CR, or it might specify a range of modifiers depending on the base creature's original Hit Dice or CR.</p>
<p><strong>Treasure:</strong> Usually the same as the base creature.</p>
<p><strong>Alignment:</strong> Usually the same as the base creature, unless the template is associated with a certain alignment.</p>
<p><strong>Advancement:</strong> Usually the same as the base creature.</p>
<p><strong>Level Adjustment:</strong> This entry is a modifier to the base creature's level adjustment. Any level adjustment is meaningless unless the creature retains a high enough Intelligence (minimum 3) to gain class levels after applying the template.</p>

<p>In theory, there's no limit to the number of templates you can add to a creature. To add more than one template, just apply each template one at a time. Always apply inherited templates before applying acquired templates. Whenever you add multiple templates, pay attention to the creature's type &ndash; you may add a template that makes the creature ineligible for other templates you might want to add.</p>

<h4 id="advanced-monster-cr">Advanced Monster Challenge Rating</h4>
<p>When adding class levels to a creature with 1 or less HD, you advance the creature like a character. Otherwise, use the following guidelines.</p>

<h4 id="adding-class-levels">Adding Class Levels</h4>
<p>If you are advancing a monster by adding player character class levels, decide if the class levels directly improve the monster's existing capabilities.</p>
<p>When adding class levels to a creature, you should give it typical ability scores appropriate for that class. Most creatures are built using the standard array of ability scores: 11, 11, 11, 10, 10, 10, adjusted by racial modifiers. If you give a creature a PC class use the elite array of ability scores before racial adjustments: 15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8. Creatures with NPC classes use the nonelite array of 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8. T</p>

<h5 id="associated-class-levels">Associated Class Levels</h5>
<p>Class levels that increase a monster's existing strengths are known as associated class levels. Each associated class level a monster has increases its CR by 1.</p>
<p>Barbarian, fighter, paladin, and ranger are associated classes for a creature that relies on its fighting ability.</p>
<p>Rogue and ranger are associated classes for a creature that relies on stealth to surprise its foes, or on skill use to give itself an advantage.</p>
<p>A spellcasting class is an associated class for a creature that already has the ability to cast spells as a character of the class in question, since the monster's levels in the spellcasting class stack with its innate spellcasting ability.</p>

<h5 id="nonassociated-class-levels">Nonassociated Class Levels</h5>
<p>If you add a class level that doesn't directly play to a creature's strength the class level is considered nonassociated, and things get a little more complicated. Adding a nonassociated class level to a monster increases its CR by 1/2 per level until one of its nonassociated class levels equals its original Hit Dice. At that point, each additional level of the same class or a similar one is considered associated and increases the monster's CR by 1.</p>
<p>Levels in NPC classes are always treated as nonassociated.</p>

<h4 id="adding-hd">Adding Hit Dice</h4>
<p>When you improve a monster by adding Hit Dice, use Table: Improved Monster CR Increase to determine the effect on the creature's CR. Keep in mind that many monsters that advance by adding Hit Dice also increase in size. Do not stack this CR increase with any increase from class levels. In general, once you've doubled a creature's CR, you should closely watch any additional increases in its abilities. Adding Hit Dice to a creature improves several of its abilities, and radical increases might not follow this progression indefinitely. Compare the monster's improved attack bonus, saving throw bonuses, and any DCs of its special abilities from the HD increase to typical characters of the appropriate level and adjust the CR accordingly.</p>

<h5 id="increasing-size">Increasing Size</h5>
<p>Generally, increasing a monster's size increases its combat effectiveness. Large creatures gain increased Strength, reach, and other benefits. Apply this modifier if you increase a creature beyond Medium and in conjunction with any other increases.</p>
<p>Be careful, though. Monsters that benefit from a smaller size may actually lose effectiveness because of a size increase. Monsters that don't benefit from size increases don't advance in that manner for this reason.</p>

<h4 id="adding-spec-abilities">Adding Special Abilities</h4>
<p>You can add any sort of spell-like, supernatural, or extraordinary ability to a creature. As with a class level, you should determine how much, or how little, this ability adds to the creature's existing repertoire. A suite of abilities that work together should be treated as a single modifier for this purpose. If the ability (or combination of abilities) significantly increases the monster's combat effectiveness, increase its CR by 2. Minor abilities increase the creature's CR by 1, and truly trivial abilities may not increase CR at all. If the special abilities a monster gains are not tied to a class or Hit Die increase, this CR increase stacks.</p>
<p>A significant special attack is one that stands a good chance of incapacitating or crippling a character in one round. A significant special quality is one that seriously diminishes the monster's vulnerability to common attacks. Do not add this factor twice if a monster has both special attacks and special qualities.</p>
<p>Make sure to "scale" your evaluation of these abilities by the monster's current CR.</p>

<h3 id="monsters-as-races">Monsters as Races</h3>
<p>While every monster has the statistics that a player would need to play the creature as a character, most monsters are not suitable as PCs. Creatures who have an Intelligence score of 2 or lower, who have no way to communicate, or who are so different from other PCs that they disrupt the campaign should not be used. Some creatures have strange innate abilities or great physical power, and thus are questionable at best as characters (except in high-level campaigns).</p>
<p id="starting-level-of-a-monster-pc"><strong>Starting Level of a Monster PC:</strong> Monsters suitable for play have a level adjustment given in their statistics. Add a monster's level adjustment to its Hit Dice and class levels to get the creature's effective character level, or ECL. Effectively, monsters with a level adjustment become multiclass character when they take class levels<em>.</em> A creature's "monster class" is always a favored class, and the creature never takes XP penalties for having it.</p>
<p id="humanoids-and-class-levels"><strong>Humanoids and Class Levels:</strong> Creatures with 1 or less HD replace their monster levels with their character levels. The monster loses the attack bonus, saving throw bonuses, skills, and feats granted by its 1 monster HD and gains the attack bonus, save bonuses, skills, feats, and other class abilities of a 1st-level character of the appropriate class.</p>
<p>Characters with more than 1 Hit Die because of their race do not get a feat for their first class level as members of the common races do, and they do not multiply the skill points for their first class level by four. Instead, they have already received a feat for their first Hit Die because of race, and they have already multiplied their racial skill points for their first Hit Die by four.</p>
<p id="level-adjust-effective-char-level"><strong>Level Adjustment and Effective Character Level:</strong> To determine the effective character level (ECL) of a monster character, add its level adjustment to its racial Hit Dice and character class levels.</p>
<p>Use ECL instead of character level to determine how many experience points a monster character needs to reach its next level. Also use ECL to determine starting wealth for a monster character.</p>
<p>Monster characters treat skills mentioned in their monster entry as class skills.</p>
<p>If a monster has 1 Hit Die or less, or if it is a template creature, it must start the game with one or more class levels, like a regular character. If a monster has 2 or more Hit Dice, it can start with no class levels (though it can gain them later).</p>
<p>Even if the creature is of a kind that normally advances by Hit Dice rather than class levels a PC can gain class levels rather than Hit Dice.</p>
<p id="hit-dice"><strong>Hit Dice:</strong> The creature's Hit Dice equal the number of class levels it has plus its racial Hit Dice. Additional Hit Dice gained from taking levels in a character class never affect a creature's size like additional racial Hit Dice do.</p>
<p id="feat-acquisition-ability-score-increases"><strong>Feat Acquisition and Ability Score Increases:</strong> A monster's total Hit Dice, not its ECL, govern its acquisition of feats and ability score increases.</p>
<p id="ability-scores-for-monster-pcs"><strong>Ability Scores for Monster PCs:</strong> While a monsters statistics give the ability scores for a typical creature of a certain kind, any "monster" creature that becomes an adventurer is definitely not typical. Therefore, when creating a PC from a creature<em>,</em> check to see if the creature's entry has any ability scores of 10 or higher. If so, for each score, subtract 10 (if the score is even) or 11 (if the score is odd) to get the creature's modifier for that ability based on its race or kind. Generate the character's ability scores as normal, then add the racial ability modifiers to get their ability scores.</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> Some monsters have base ability scores other than 10 and 11. If alternate scores were used this will be indicated in the monster entry. Also, some monsters that make good PCs have their racial ability modifiers and other traits already listed in their monster entry.</p>
<p>For ability scores lower than 10, the procedure is different. First, determine the character's ability scores, and compare that number to the monster's average ability score, using either the table below that applies to Intelligence or the table that applies to the other five ability scores.</p>
<p>The separate table for Intelligence ensures that no PC ends up with an Intelligence score lower than 3. This is important, because creatures with an Intelligence score lower than 3 are not playable characters. Creatures with any ability score lower than 1 are also not playable.</p>

<div id="humanoid" class="type-box">
    <h5>Humanoid Type</h5>
    <p>A humanoid usually has two arms, two legs, and one head, or a humanlike torso, arms, and a head. Humanoids have few or no supernatural or extraordinary abilities, but most can speak and usually have well-developed societies. They usually are Small or Medium. Every humanoid creature also has a subtype.</p>
    <p>Humanoids with 1 Hit Die exchange the features of their humanoid Hit Die for the class features of a PC or NPC class. Humanoids of this sort are presented as 1st-level warriors, which means that they have average combat ability and poor saving throws.</p>
    <p>Humanoids with more than 1 Hit Die are the only humanoids who make use of the features of the humanoid type.</p>
    <p><em>Features:</em> A humanoid has the following features (unless otherwise noted in a creature's entry).</p>
    <ul>
        <li>8-sided Hit Dice, or by character class.</li>
        <li>Base attack bonus equal to 3/4 total Hit Dice (as cleric).</li>
        <li>Good Reflex saves (usually; a humanoid's good save varies).</li>
        <li>Skill points equal to (2 + Int modifier, minimum 1) per Hit Die, with quadruple skill points for the first Hit Die, or by character class.</li>

    <p>An outsider is at least partially composed of the essence (but not necessarily the material) of some plane other than the Material Plane. Some creatures start out as some other type and become outsiders when they attain a higher (or lower) state of spiritual existence.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Darkvision out to 60 feet.</li>
        <li>Unlike most other living creatures, an outsider does not have a dual nature &ndash; its soul and body form one unit. When an outsider is slain, no soul is set loose. Spells that restore souls to their bodies, such as <em>raise dead, reincarnate</em>, and <em>resurrection</em>, don't work on an outsider. It takes a different magical effect, such as <em>limited wish, wish, miracle</em>, or <em>true resurrection</em> to restore it to life. An outsider with the native subtype can be raised, reincarnated, or resurrected just as other living creatures can be.</li>

        <li>Uses its Charisma modifier for <em>concentration</em> checks.</li>

<h4 id="subtypes">Creature Subtypes</h4>
<p id="air"><strong>Air Subtype:</strong> This subtype usually is used for elementals and outsiders with a connection to the Elemental Plane Air. Air creatures always have fly speeds and usually have perfect maneuverability.</p>

<p id="angel"><strong>Angel Subtype:</strong> Angels are a race of celestials, or good outsiders, native to the good-aligned Outer Planes.</p>
<p><em>Traits:</em> An angel possesses the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature's entry).</p>
<ul>
    <li>Darkvision out to 60 feet and low-light vision.</li>
    <li>Immunity to acid, cold, and petrification.</li>
    <li>Resistance to electricity 10 and fire 10.</li>
    <li>+4 racial bonus on saves against poison.</li>
    <li>Protective Aura (Su): Against attacks made or effects created by evil creatures, this ability provides a +4 deflection bonus to AC and a +4 resistance bonus on saving throws to anyone within 20 feet of the angel. Otherwise, it functions as a <em>magic circle against evil</em> effect and a <em>lesser globe of invulnerability</em>, both with a radius of 20 feet (caster level equals angel's HD). (The defensive benefits from the circle are not included in an angel's statistics block.)</li>
    <li>Tongues (Su): All angels can speak with any creature that has a language, as though using a <em>tongues</em> spell (caster level equal to angel's Hit Dice). This ability is always active.</li>
</ul>

<p id="aquatic"><strong>Aquatic Subtype:</strong> These creatures always have swim speeds and thus can move in water without making <em>swim</em> checks. An aquatic creature can breathe underwater. It cannot also breathe air unless it has the amphibious special quality.</p>

<p id="archon"><strong>Archon Subtype:</strong> Archons are a race of celestials, or good outsiders, native to lawful good-aligned Outer Planes.</p>
<p><em>Traits:</em> An archon possesses the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature's entry).</p>
<ul>
    <li>Darkvision out to 60 feet and low-light vision.</li>
    <li>Aura of Menace (Su): A righteous aura surrounds archons that fight or get angry. Any hostile creature within a 20-foot radius of an archon must succeed on a Will save to resist its effects. The save DC varies with the type of archon, is Charisma-based, and includes a +2 racial bonus. Those who fail take a -2 penalty on attacks, AC, and saves for 24 hours or until they successfully hit the archon that generated the aura. A creature that has resisted or broken the effect cannot be affected again by the same archon's aura for 24 hours.</li>
    <li>Immunity to electricity and petrification.</li>
    <li>+4 racial bonus on saves against poison.</li>
    <li>Magic Circle against Evil (Su): A magic circle against evil effect always surrounds an archon (caster level equals the archon's Hit Dice). (The defensive benefits from the circle are not included in an archon's statistics block.)</li>
    <li>Teleport (Su): Archons can use greater teleport at will, as the spell (caster level 14th), except that the creature can transport only itself and up to 50 pounds of objects.</li>
    <li>Tongues (Su): All archons can speak with any creature that has a language, as though using a <em>tongues</em> spell (caster level 14th). This ability is always active.</li>
</ul>

<p id="augmented"><strong>Augmented Subtype:</strong> A creature receives this subtype whenever something happens to change its original type. Some creatures (those with an inherited template) are born with this subtype; others acquire it when they take on an acquired template. The augmented subtype is always paired with the creature's original type. A creature with the augmented subtype usually has the traits of its current type, but the features of its original type.</p>

<p id="chaotic"><strong>Chaotic Subtype:</strong> A subtype usually applied only to outsiders native to the chaotic-aligned Outer Planes. Most creatures that have this subtype also have chaotic alignments; however, if their alignments change they still retain the subtype. Any effect that depends on alignment affects a creature with this subtype as if the creature has a chaotic alignment, no matter what its alignment actually is. The creature also suffers effects according to its actual alignment. A creature with the chaotic subtype overcomes damage reduction as if its natural weapons and any weapons it wields were chaotic-aligned (see Damage Reduction, below).</p>

<p id="cold"><strong>Cold Subtype:</strong> A creature with the cold subtype has immunity to cold. It has vulnerability to fire, which means it takes half again as much (+50%) damage as normal from fire, regardless of whether a saving throw is allowed, or if the save is a success or failure.</p>

<p id="earth"><strong>Earth Subtype:</strong> This subtype usually is used for elementals and outsiders with a connection to the Elemental Plane of Earth. Earth creatures usually have burrow speeds, and most earth creatures can burrow through solid rock.</p>

<p id="evil"><strong>Evil Subtype:</strong> A subtype usually applied only to outsiders native to the evil-aligned Outer Planes. Evil outsiders are also called fiends. Most creatures that have this subtype also have evil alignments; however, if their alignments change, they still retain the subtype. Any effect that depends on alignment affects a creature with this subtype as if the creature has an evil alignment, no matter what its alignment actually is. The creature also suffers effects according to its actual alignment. A creature with the evil subtype overcomes damage reduction as if its natural weapons and any weapons it wields were evil-aligned (see Damage Reduction, above).</p>

<p id="extraplanar"><strong>Extraplanar Subtype:</strong> A subtype applied to any creature when it is on a plane other than its native plane. A creature that travels the planes can gain or lose this subtype as it goes from plane to plane. Monster entries assume that encounters with creatures take place on the Material Plane, and every creature whose native plane is not the Material Plane has the extraplanar subtype (but would not have when on its home plane). Every extraplanar creature in this book has a home plane mentioned in its description. Creatures not labeled as extraplanar are natives of the Material Plane, and they gain the extraplanar subtype if they leave the Material Plane. No creature has the extraplanar subtype when it is on a transitive plane, such as the Astral Plane, the Ethereal Plane, and the Plane of Shadow.</p>

<p id="fire"><strong>Fire Subtype:</strong> A creature with the fire subtype has immunity to fire. It has vulnerability to cold, which means it takes half again as much (+50%) damage as normal from cold, regardless of whether a saving throw is allowed, or if the save is a success or failure.</p>

<p id="goblinoid"><strong>Goblinoid Subtype:</strong> Goblinoids are stealthy humanoids who live by hunting and raiding and who all speak Goblin.</p>

<p id="good"><strong>Good Subtype:</strong> A subtype usually applied only to outsiders native to the good-aligned Outer Planes. Most creatures that have this subtype also have good alignments; however, if their alignments change, they still retain the subtype. Any effect that depends on alignment affects a creature with this subtype as if the creature has a good alignment, no matter what its alignment actually is. The creature also suffers effects according to its actual alignment. A creature with the good subtype overcomes damage reduction as if its natural weapons and any weapons it wields were good-aligned (see Damage Reduction, above).</p>

<p id="incorporeal"><strong>Incorporeal Subtype:</strong> An incorporeal creature has no physical body. It can be harmed only by other incorporeal creatures, magic weapons or creatures that strike as magic weapons, and spells, spell-like abilities, or supernatural abilities. It is immune to all nonmagical attack forms. Even when hit by spells or magic weapons, it has a 50% chance to ignore any damage from a corporeal source (except for positive energy, negative energy, force effects such as <em>magic missile</em>, or attacks made with <em>ghost touch</em> weapons). Although it is not a magical attack, holy water can affect incorporeal undead, but a hit with holy water has a 50% chance of not affecting an incorporeal creature.</p>
<p>An incorporeal creature has no natural armor bonus but has a deflection bonus equal to its Charisma bonus (always at least +1, even if the creature's Charisma score does not normally provide a bonus).</p>
<p>An incorporeal creature can enter or pass through solid objects, but must remain adjacent to the object's exterior, and so cannot pass entirely through an object whose space is larger than its own. It can sense the presence of creatures or objects within a square adjacent to its current location, but enemies have total concealment (50% miss chance) from an incorporeal creature that is inside an object. In order to see farther from the object it is in and attack normally, the incorporeal creature must emerge. An incorporeal creature inside an object has total cover, but when it attacks a creature outside the object it only has cover, so a creature outside with a readied action could strike at it as it attacks. An incorporeal creature cannot pass through a force effect.</p>
<p>An incorporeal creature's attacks pass through (ignore) natural armor, armor, and shields, although deflection bonuses and force effects (such as <em>mage armor</em>) work normally against it. Incorporeal creatures pass through and operate in water as easily as they do in air. Incorporeal creatures cannot fall or take falling damage. Incorporeal creatures cannot make trip or grapple attacks, nor can they be tripped or grappled. In fact, they cannot take any physical action that would move or manipulate an opponent or its equipment, nor are they subject to such actions. Incorporeal creatures have no weight and do not set off traps that are triggered by weight.</p>
<p>An incorporeal creature moves silently and cannot be heard with <em>listen</em> checks if it doesn't wish to be. It has no Strength score, so its Dexterity modifier applies to both its melee attacks and its ranged attacks. Nonvisual senses, such as scent and blindsight, are either ineffective or only partly effective with regard to incorporeal creatures. Incorporeal creatures have an innate sense of direction and can move at full speed even when they cannot see.</p>

<p id="lawful"><strong>Lawful:</strong> A subtype usually applied only to outsiders native to the lawful-aligned Outer Planes. Most creatures that have this subtype also have lawful alignments; however, if their alignments change, they still retain the subtype. Any effect that depends on alignment affects a creature with this subtype as if the creature has a lawful alignment, no matter what its alignment actually is. The creature also suffers effects according to its actual alignment. A creature with the lawful subtype overcomes damage reduction as if its natural weapons and any weapons it wields were lawful-aligned (see Damage Reduction, above).</p>

<p id="native"><strong>Native Subtype:</strong> A subtype applied only to outsiders. These creatures have mortal ancestors or a strong connection to the Material Plane and can be raised, reincarnated, or resurrected just as other living creatures can be. Creatures with this subtype are native to the Material Plane (hence the subtype's name). Unlike true outsiders, native outsiders need to eat and sleep.</p>

<p id="reptillian"><strong>Reptilian Subtype:</strong> These creatures are scaly and usually coldblooded. The reptilian subtype is only used to describe a set of humanoid races, not all animals and monsters that are truly reptiles.</p>

<p id="shapechanger"><strong>Shapechanger Subtype:</strong> A shapechanger has the supernatural ability to assume one or more alternate forms. Many magical effects allow some kind of shape shifting, and not every creature that can change shapes has the shapechanger subtype.</p>
<p><em>Traits:</em> A shapechanger possesses the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature's entry).</p>
<ul>
    <li>Proficient with its natural weapons, with simple weapons, and with any weapons mentioned in the creature's description.</li>
    <li>Proficient with any armor mentioned in the creature's description, as well as all lighter forms. If no form of armor is mentioned, the shapechanger is not proficient with armor. A shapechanger is proficient with shields if it is proficient with any type of armor.</li>
</ul>

<p id="swarm"><strong>Swarm Subtype:</strong> A swarm is a collection of Fine, Diminutive, or Tiny creatures that acts as a single creature. A swarm has the characteristics of its type, except as noted here. A swarm has a single pool of Hit Dice and hit points, a single initiative modifier, a single speed, and a single Armor Class. A swarm makes saving throws as a single creature. A single swarm occupies a square (if it is made up of nonflying creatures) or a cube (of flying creatures) 10 feet on a side, but its reach is 0 feet, like its component creatures. In order to attack, it moves into an opponent's space, which provokes an attack of opportunity. It can occupy the same space as a creature of any size, since it crawls all over its prey. A swarm can move through squares occupied by enemies and vice versa without impediment, although the swarm provokes an attack of opportunity if it does so. A swarm can move through cracks or holes large enough for its component creatures.</p>
<p>A swarm of Tiny creatures consists of 300 nonflying creatures or 1,000 flying creatures. A swarm of Diminutive creatures consists of 1,500 nonflying creatures or 5,000 flying creatures. A swarm of Fine creatures consists of 10,000 creatures, whether they are flying or not. Swarms of nonflying creatures include many more creatures than could normally fit in a 10-foot square based on their normal space, because creatures in a swarm are packed tightly together and generally crawl over each other and their prey when moving or attacking. Larger swarms are represented by multiples of single swarms. The area occupied by a large swarm is completely shapeable, though the swarm usually remains in contiguous squares.</p>
<p><em>Traits:</em> A swarm has no clear front or back and no discernable anatomy, so it is not subject to critical hits or flanking. A swarm made up of Tiny creatures takes half damage from slashing and piercing weapons. A swarm composed of Fine or Diminutive creatures is immune to all weapon damage. Reducing a swarm to 0 hit points or lower causes it to break up, though damage taken until that point does not degrade its ability to attack or resist attack. Swarms are never staggered or reduced to a dying state by damage. Also, they cannot be tripped, grappled, or bull rushed, and they cannot grapple an opponent.</p>
<p>A swarm is immune to any spell or effect that targets a specific number of creatures (including single-target spells such as <em>disintegrate</em>), with the exception of mind-affecting effects (charms, compulsions, phantasms, patterns, and morale effects) if the swarm has an Intelligence score and a hive mind. A swarm takes half again as much damage (+50%) from spells or effects that affect an area, such as splash weapons and many evocation spells.</p>
<p>Swarms made up of Diminutive or Fine creatures are susceptible to high winds such as that created by a <em>gust of wind</em> spell. For purposes of determining the effects of wind on a swarm, treat the swarm as a creature of the same size as its constituent creatures. A swarm rendered unconscious by means of nonlethal damage becomes disorganized and dispersed, and does not reform until its hit points exceed its nonlethal damage.</p>
<p><em>Swarm Attack:</em> Creatures with the swarm subtype don't make standard melee attacks. Instead, they deal automatic damage to any creature whose space they occupy at the end of their move, with no attack roll needed. Swarm attacks are not subject to a miss chance for concealment or cover. A swarm's statistics block has "swarm" in the Attack and Full Attack entries, with no attack bonus given. The amount of damage a swarm deals is based on its Hit Dice, as shown below.</p>
<table id="swarm-table" class="table table-bordered table-hover">
    <caption>Table: Swarm Damage</caption>
    <thead>
        <tr><th>Swarm HD</th><th>Swarm Base Damage</th></tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr><td>1-5</td><td>1d6</td></tr>
        <tr><td>6-10</td><td>2d6</td></tr>
        <tr><td>11-15</td><td>3d6</td></tr>
        <tr><td>16-20</td><td>4d6</td></tr>
        <tr><td>21 or more</td><td>5d6</td></tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
<p>A swarm's attacks are nonmagical, unless the swarm's description states otherwise. Damage reduction sufficient to reduce a swarm attack's damage to 0, being incorporeal, and other special abilities usually give a creature immunity (or at least resistance) to damage from a swarm. Some swarms also have acid, poison, blood drain, or other special attacks in addition to normal damage.</p>
<p>Swarms do not threaten creatures in their square, and do not make attacks of opportunity with their swarm attack. However, they distract foes whose squares they occupy, as described below.</p>
<p><em>Distraction (Ex):</em> Any living creature vulnerable to a swarm's damage that begins its turn with a swarm in its square is nauseated for 1 round; a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 swarm's HD + swarm's Con modifier; the exact DC is given in a swarm's description) negates the effect. Spellcasting or concentrating on spells within the area of a swarm requires a <em>concentration</em> check (DC 20 + spell level). Using skills that involve patience and concentration requires a DC 20 <em>concentration</em> check.</p>

<p id="water"><strong>Water Subtype:</strong> This subtype usually is used for elementals and outsiders with a connection to the Elemental Plane of Water. Creatures with the water subtype always have swim speeds and can move in water without making <em>swim</em> checks. A water creature can breathe underwater and usually can breathe air as well.</p>
