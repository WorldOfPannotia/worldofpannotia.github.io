<pre>
Brian: thought of something while mowing the other day
  thought it might be an interesting thing for your game
  ever heard of Gotterdamerung
 me: the name is familiar, but don't know what it is
 Brian: it's german
  it means twilight of the gods
10:23 PM monster magnet has a song called baby Gotterdamerung
  not that great of a song but I like the title
  and it got me thinking
  what would a world like yours fear?
 me: hmmm
 Brian: the twilight of the gods... especially if it was in the form of a creature
  like the tarrasque, sort of
  but it was still only a baby at the moment
  but one day it would grow up and destroy them all
10:24 PM what would they do about it?
 me: and then the whole process would start over?
 Brian: especially if they were unable to affect it directly?
  perhaps
  I think they'd hire adventurers to do it
 me: i like the concept
 Brian: or maybe even try to divert likely tournament contestants to fight the baby instead
  so that way either they'd die and not be a threat, or they'd succeed adn the gods would be assured continued dominance
10:25 PM me: it'd be very hard to figure out how to create something that deities (who are basically epic characters) couldn't hurt but normal epic characters could
 Brian: possibly even lie and say it was required
  that would probably be where DM's privelege would come in
 me: very interesting concept
 Brian: probably something similar to a golem's magic resistance
  anything that allows spell resistance, it's immune to
  same deal with this, only anything with a divine rank it ignores
10:26 PM and it's quite beefy in its own right on top of that
  and it could be quite possibly very hidden
 me: at least as beefy as the tarrasque
 Brian: and the gods wouldn't want normal people to know about its existence
  it would show their weaknesses, at least eventually
 me: or perhaps it is a variant on the terrasque, and just don't include the big T in the setting
 Brian: and it could decimate the tournament
  nod
  tarrasque with some templates perhaps
10:27 PM I think they even did that on the wizards site... made up some templated tarrasques
  anyway though... I thought it would be an interesting idea for your world and I wanted to let you know before I forgot


Drow are &quot;night elves&quot;
Live just below the surface, in [[Katoa]]
They come out at night and hunt

<h3>Location Ideas</h3>
<h4>Jorgan's Peak</h4>
<p>This is a pronounced singular mountain that towers over the surrounding hills prominently. It was once an active volcano some 300 years ago. It is now home to 3 clans of dwarves who have successfully constructed a vast network of tunnels and about two dozen fortresses and granite keeps on the mountain and in the sourrounding hill country. This specific region has been successfuly cleared of all wandering beasts by the dwarves. The 3 clans have grown extremely rich as a result of the vast gold deposits found within the solid rock depths of the mountain and its immediate foot hills. The area has a very active geothermal feature resulting in great hot geysers and in the presence of dozens of bubbling hot springs with a strong stench of sulphur and minerals and boiling mud pools.</p>
<p>The 3 clans have lived and integrated successfuly in the 200 years that they have occupied this small region and they have well established trade links with the human communities in the areas surrounding the hills of Jorgan's Peak.</p>
<p>Thodun Stone, an up and coming Vicar of the faith of Moradin, the Celestial Smith, sought to increase his power and popularity among the faithful, in light of the imminent death of the ancient Grand Patriach of Moradin, by harnessing the ancient and vast elemental energies that are still locked deep within the core of the mountain a fortnight ago. Unknown to him, while he successfully managed to connect his psyche to the deep fires of the ancient volcano to increase his awareness in manipulating the energies of the fire element, he'd inadvertently awoken a slumbering entity - an ancient efreeti that was locked within this mountain as a result of having lost a contest in an age lost in the mist of time and has spent countless centuries seeking a way to escape its prison before succumbing to a deep sleep and its inevitable fate...until now.</p>
<hr />
<h4>Princes of the Iron Stair</h4>
<p>In a past age, the dwarven clan of Ironfoot held mines in a ridge of rotten base-metal ores known as the Waste Crag, within a range of dreary border uplands between the civilised lands and a wide goblin-haunted heath beyond. Hard was their lot and they were beset by the great goblin chiefs, who hated them, sending murderous hordes against their poor defences.</p>
<p>In desperation, the headmen of the clan took to the tunnels leading down into the roots of the mountains and parleyed with those they found there. Fell bargains were made, an alliance agreed and the dwarves began to delve a wide road into the deep, to join together for all time the mountain dwarves and the grey ones.''</p>
<p>Armed with duergar smithcraft and mercenary legions, the dwarves of the Iron Stair threw back their attackers, then, the next season, marched out against them. In the wars that followed they wiped four tribes of goblins from the earth and their name grew great among the dwarves. (The moors are no longer known for their goblins - wandering settlers of other races moved in after the bandit tribes were destroyed.)</p>
<p>Some dwarven clans came to the Iron Stair willingly for protection, others they subjugated. The Princes reduced these all to serfdom, calling them the Underclans of the hold. Human villages, too, and goblin thralls serve them.</p>
<p>The halls surrounding the gates of the Iron Stair have a harsh, minimal grandeur and an atmosphere of grim suspicion that is untypical of the more joyous hill dwarf towns. Their enemies say that diabolists live openly among the merchant halls and that some of the Iron Stair dwarves keep cellars where they experiment in necromancy. An estranged church of Moradin still seems to gain favour from the Dwarffather, perhaps in a darker aspect (or it may be that another source grants them spells) but it is said that many of the princes of the blood and the Ironguard officers give worship instead in the blank stone shrines of Laduguer.</p>
<h5>The Ironguard</h5>
<p>The elite enforcers of the Iron Stair's will all wear the heaviest plate armour known to the world. They fight in close-ordered ranks, trained with the halberd and their choice of close-combat weapons. Ironguard warriors boast of their duelling skills with broadsword, twin axes or for the quickest of them, paired daggers. Ironguard members are also sent out into the Princes' domain individually or in small command squads, serving as the hard core of detachments of lesser troops, to bring village leaders and rebels to heel.</p>
<p>The Ironguard dwell apart in their own well-guarded barracks. They recruit from both the princely bloodline and from their dwarven subjects, who vie for the honour of renouncing their underclan and adopting into the Ironguard as their only family. It's easy to speculate that the grey slab-faces of duergar or even the eyeless horrors of grimlocks may hide behind some of the closed-face Ironguard helms.</p>
<p>The Ironguard wear only plain dun tunics under their plate and shun jewels. Almost their sole expression of flamboyance is in ironwork, with fantastical carved visors and helms, bloody battle-scenes etched on their armour plates, weapon spurs and chains. Out of their armour, though, warriors may display surprising tattoos across their torsos and shaved heads.</p>
<h5>Lesser troops</h5>
<p>The heavy infantry are supported by crossbowmen, spearmen, swordsmen and light horsemen from the underclans and human mercenaries. These hirelings are not to be relied on against a heavy attack, but still the Princes share the wealth of the kingdom with good chainmail and mass-produced weapons.</p>
<p>Siege engineers are well supported and prominent in the Princes' campaigns. In the past, they have made use of magically enhanced attacks and dire creatures herded from the underdark or the Lower Planes.</p>
<h5>Goblin skirmishers</h5>
<p>From the early days of the Iron Stair, broken goblin septs chose to hire on with the dwarves as an alternative to mass execution. They now lord it over their slave relatives due to their warrior status. Goblin squads fight as archers and lightly armed troops. The Princes have experimented successfully with re-creating wolf-rider squads - these pressed troops, trained by dwarves, do not have worgs and do not gain the usual goblin bonus to Ride. Their colonels are Ironguard mounted on hellhounds.</p>
<h5>Industries</h5>
<p>Iron, bronze, brass, lead and stone and skilled workers therein. Their human and goblin subjects also do some good-quality weaving.</p>

<h4>Lakefleet, The City of Rafts</h4>
<p>Lakefleet is actually a series of houseboats connected by collapsible ladders - a floating city. The population is mainly human, with a few elves and halflings as well. Lakefleet is a center of trade - if prospects are bad in one area, they can simply sail to a new one, and this flexibility gives the merchants unrivaled opportunites.</p>
<p>As might be expected, the primary diet in Lakefleet is fish, as fresh as it can get. As a result, aspiring chefs from all over the country travel to Lakefleet, hoping to learn in the kitchen of Kevin Bluefin (LG Human Expert 17), the greatest chef in all of Lakefleet.</p>
<p>The leader of Lakefleet is Corselia Seneca, a former navy tactician who's getting on in years. Despite her advancing years, her mind's still sharp, much to the chagrin of a few of Lakefleet's overly-ambitious merchant princes. Corselia is expected to retire soon, and there's quite a bit of a jockeying for power among Lakefleet's elite in preparation for when that day finally comes.</p>
<p>One of the most famous structures in the City of Rafts is Blue Mermaid Inn, run by a family of shoal halflings (Stormwrack p.45) named the Waverunners (Singular Waverunner). The inn is built on a fairly large raft, rather than a houseboat, and extends below the surface of the raft, allowing aquatic races to use the inn as well. There are several stories told in Lakefleet centering around the Inn as a place where human and merfolk lovers meet - these stories range from the baudy to the romantic. Talia Waverunner, the clan's only bard, knows all of these stories by heart and is currently working on turning one of them - a tragedy - into a play.</p>
<hr />
<h4>Unnamed Mountain Village</h4>
<p>A small town/village hidden deep in the mountains where people stop aging after childhood (or age very slowly). There is something about the area (which cannot be divined through magic, psionics, or otherwise) that prolongs the life of its inhabitants.</p>
<p>However, if they leave the area, their age catches up with them. In other words, they age at an advanced rate until their physical age reaches their actual age. This can result in death for people who have spent significant lengths of time living there.</p>
<p>Inspiration: the Star Trek movie (Insurrection?).</p>
