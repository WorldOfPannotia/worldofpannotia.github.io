<h4>Ideas</h4>
<p>This is the upshot of my current ideas:</p>
<p>4 "elemental" arenas, each embodying one of the four basic elements, so for example:</p>
<p>Air: Open room, many platforms at varying levels, with ladders and ropes etc, with mobility being the main advantage</p>
<p>Earth: Underground, narrow, claustrophobic spaces, darkness</p>
<p>Water: Submerged, but with strategic air pockets, victory mainly depending on using these to the best advantage</p>
<p>Fire: emphasis is on natural hazards which must be avoided</p>
