<h4>Description</h4>
Recently went to <a href="{{ site.url }}/setting-info/history/events/anglius-beachhedge-war/">war</a> with <a href="{{ site.url }}/setting-info/geography/cities/beachhedge/">Beachhedge</a> over their use of undead as labor. This city has a large number of temples devoted to good deities who concern themselves with the destruction of undead.
The majority of the population here is good, with some leaning towards neutral tendancies.
Humans make up most of the town, with some elves, gnomes and even a few dwarves.
