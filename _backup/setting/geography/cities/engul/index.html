<h4>Description</h4>
When travelers come to this city, they are struck by its lack of.... existence. There is nothing visible where this city should be. In fact, it is not even on some maps. In truth, the city is beneath the ground. This is the largest known entrance to <a href="{{ site.url }}/setting-info/geography/katoa/">Katoa</a>, or what is commonly called _The Deep World_. Engul is the home city of the drow, and it is from here that many drow incursions on the surface world.
