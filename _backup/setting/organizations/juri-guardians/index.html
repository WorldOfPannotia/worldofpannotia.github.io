<h4>Number of Members:</h4>
Always 200
<h4>History:</h4>

    The Guardians serve as the elite guard and direct hand of the emperor in
    the Juri Empire. They were established during the first age, when the
    empire was founded. They are some of the strongest and most feared
    warriors in all of Pannotia because of their devotion to their emperor.

<h4>Organization:</h4>

    Each and every member of the Guardians is a werelion, and only natural
    lycanthropes are allowed into membership. Thus, in order for an
    individual to become a member of the Guardians, they must be a child of
    a Guardian. In some rare cases, a potential parent may petition the
    emperor for the privilege of being bitten by one of the Guardians, in
    the hope that their children may one day join the ranks of this elite
    organization.

<h4>Leader Bio:</h4>

    The Guardians are led by the emperor of the Juri Empire. However, only
    one Guardian is allowed to speak directly to the emperor. He is the
    Captain of the Guardians, and his name is Laoru. Laoru is one of only a
    handful current Guardians who was not directly descended from a family
    of Guardians. In his case, his father sought, and obtained, permission
    from the emperor to be made into a lycanthrope. After Laoru was born, he
    was taken into custody of the Guardians and raised by a surrogate
    family. His dedication to the empire showed in his service, and he rose
    through the ranks of the Guardians, eventually becoming the first
    Captain of the Guardians with no ancestral ties to the organization.
