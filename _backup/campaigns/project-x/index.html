<h3>Campaign Overview</h3>
<p>My plan for Project X is to have a campaign in which the PCs may end up shaping the course of history in Pannotia. I have a number of plots in mind for the campaign, and the path the party chooses will have a direct impact on the chain of events.</p>
<p>I am keeping things somewhat close to the vest for the present, but more details about the campaign will be revealed over time.</p>

<h3>Alignment and Party Cohesion</h3>
<p>I don't have a huge preference for the group's alignment, other than "no evil characters". I do, however, want the group to have some kind of common link prior to the beginning of the story. I haven't figured out what it will be yet, but it will likely be some kind of organization or guild.</p>
<p>My goal is to eliminate the need for the typical "You seem like a trustworthy fellow. Join our group of adventurers!" scenario. Since the party is starting at a fairly high level (see "Character Creation" below), it doesn't seem like that would fit in this campaign.</p>
