<h4 id="cover">Cover</h4>
<p>To determine whether your target has cover from your ranged attack, choose a corner of your square. If any line from this corner to any corner of the target's square passes through a square or border that blocks line of effect or provides cover, or through a square occupied by a creature, the target has cover (+4 to AC).</p>
<p>When making a melee attack against an adjacent target, your target has cover if any line from your square to the target's square goes through a wall (including a low wall). When making a melee attack against a target that isn't adjacent to you (such as with a reach weapon), use the rules for determining cover from ranged attacks.</p>
<p><strong>Low Obstacles and Cover:</strong> A low obstacle (such as a wall no higher than half your height) provides cover, but only to creatures within 30 feet (6 squares) of it. The attacker can ignore the cover if he's closer to the obstacle than his target.</p>
<p><strong>Cover and Attacks of Opportunity:</strong> You can't execute an attack of opportunity against an opponent with cover relative to you.</p>
<p><strong>Cover and Reflex Saves:</strong> Cover grants you a +2 bonus on Reflex saves against attacks that originate or burst out from a point on the other side of the cover from you. Note that spread effects can extend around corners and thus negate this cover bonus.</p>
<p><strong>Cover and Hide Checks:</strong> You can use cover to make a Hide check. Without cover, you usually need concealment (see below) to make a Hide check.</p>
<p><strong>Soft Cover:</strong> Creatures, even your enemies, can provide you with cover against ranged attacks, giving you a +4 bonus to AC. However, such soft cover provides no bonus on Reflex saves, nor does soft cover allow you to make a Hide check.</p>
<p><strong>Big Creatures and Cover:</strong> Any creature with a space larger than 5 feet (1 square) determines cover against melee attacks slightly differently than smaller creatures do. Such a creature can choose any square that it occupies to determine if an opponent has cover against its melee attacks. Similarly, when making a melee attack against such a creature, you can pick any of the squares it occupies to determine if it has cover against you.</p>
<p><strong>Total Cover:</strong> If you don't have line of effect to your target he is considered to have total cover from you. You can't make an attack against a target that has total cover.</p>
<p><strong>Varying Degrees of Cover:</strong> In some cases, cover may provide a greater bonus to AC and Reflex saves. In such situations the normal cover bonuses to AC and Reflex saves can be doubled (to +8 and +4, respectively). A creature with this improved cover effectively gains improved evasion against any attack to which the Reflex save bonus applies. Furthermore, improved cover provides a +10 bonus on Hide checks.</p>

<h4 id="concealment">Concealment</h4>
<p>To determine whether your target has concealment from your ranged attack, choose a corner of your square. If any line from this corner to any corner of the target's square passes through a square or border that provides concealment, the target has concealment.</p>
<p>When making a melee attack against an adjacent target, your target has concealment if his space is entirely within an effect that grants concealment. When making a melee attack against a target that isn't adjacent to you use the rules for determining concealment from ranged attacks.</p>
<p>In addition, some magical effects provide concealment against all attacks, regardless of whether any intervening concealment exists.</p>
<p><strong>Concealment Miss Chance:</strong> Concealment gives the subject of a successful attack a 20% chance that the attacker missed because of the concealment. If the attacker hits, the defender must make a miss chance percentile roll to avoid being struck. Multiple concealment conditions do not stack.</p>
<p><strong>Concealment and Hide Checks:</strong> You can use concealment to make a Hide check. Without concealment, you usually need cover to make a Hide check.</p>
<p><strong>Total Concealment:</strong> If you have line of effect to a target but not line of sight he is considered to have total concealment from you. You can't attack an opponent that has total concealment, though you can attack into a square that you think he occupies. A successful attack into a square occupied by an enemy with total concealment has a 50% miss chance (instead of the normal 20% miss chance for an opponent with concealment).</p>
<p>You can't execute an attack of opportunity against an opponent with total concealment, even if you know what square or squares the opponent occupies.</p>
<p><strong>Ignoring Concealment:</strong> Concealment isn't always effective. A shadowy area or darkness doesn't provide any concealment against an opponent with darkvision. Characters with low-light vision can see clearly for a greater distance with the same light source than other characters. Although invisibility provides total concealment, sighted opponents may still make Spot checks to notice the location of an invisible character. An invisible character gains a +20 bonus on Hide checks if moving, or a +40 bonus on Hide checks when not moving (even though opponents can't see you, they might be able to figure out where you are from other visual clues).</p>
<p><strong>Varying Degrees of Concealment:</strong> Certain situations may provide more or less than typical concealment, and modify the miss chance accordingly.</p>

<h4 id="flanking">Flanking</h4>
<p>When making a melee attack, you get a +2 flanking bonus if your opponent is threatened by a character or creature friendly to you on the opponent's opposite border or opposite corner.</p>
<p>When in doubt about whether two friendly characters flank an opponent in the middle, trace an imaginary line between the two friendly characters' centers. If the line passes through opposite borders of the opponent's space (including corners of those borders), then the opponent is flanked.</p>
<p><em>Exception:</em> If a flanker takes up more than 1 square, it gets the flanking bonus if any square it occupies counts for flanking.</p>
<p>Only a creature or character that threatens the defender can help an attacker get a flanking bonus.</p>
<p>Creatures with a reach of 0 feet can't flank an opponent.</p>

<h4 id="helpless-defenders">Helpless Defenders</h4>
<p>A helpless opponent is someone who is bound, sleeping, paralyzed, unconscious, or otherwise at your mercy.</p>
<p><strong>Regular Attack:</strong> A helpless character takes a -4 penalty to AC against melee attacks, but no penalty to AC against ranged attacks.</p>
<p>A helpless defender can't use any Dexterity bonus to AC. In fact, his Dexterity score is treated as if it were 0 and his Dexterity modifier to AC as if it were -5 (and a rogue can sneak attack him).</p>
<p><strong>Coup de Grace:</strong> As a full-round action, you can use a melee weapon to deliver a coup de grace to a helpless opponent. You can also use a bow or crossbow, provided you are adjacent to the target.</p>
<p>You automatically hit and score a critical hit. If the defender survives the damage, he must make a Fortitude save (DC 10 + damage dealt) or die. A rogue also gets her extra sneak attack damage against a helpless opponent when delivering a coup de grace.</p>
<p>Delivering a coup de grace provokes attacks of opportunity from threatening opponents.</p>
<p>You can't deliver a coup de grace against a creature that is immune to critical hits. You can deliver a coup de grace against a creature with total concealment, but doing this requires two consecutive full-round actions (one to "find" the creature once you've determined what square it's in, and one to deliver the coup de grace).</p>

<h4 id="aid-another">Aid Another</h4>
<p>In melee combat, you can help a friend attack or defend by distracting or interfering with an opponent. If you're in position to make a melee attack on an opponent that is engaging a friend in melee combat, you can attempt to aid your friend as a standard action. You make an attack roll against AC 10. If you succeed, your friend gains either a +2 bonus on his next attack roll against that opponent or a +2 bonus to AC against that opponent's next attack (your choice), as long as that attack comes before the beginning of your next turn. Multiple characters can aid the same friend, and similar bonuses stack.</p>
<p>You can also use this standard action to help a friend in other ways, such as when he is affected by a spell, or to assist another character's skill check.</p>

<h4 id="bull-rush">Bull Rush</h4>
<p>You can make a bull rush as a standard action (an attack) or as part of a charge (see Charge, below). When you make a bull rush, you attempt to push an opponent straight back instead of damaging him. You can only bull rush an opponent who is one size category larger than you, the same size, or smaller.</p>
<p><strong>Initiating a Bull Rush:</strong> First, you move into the defender's space. Doing this provokes an attack of opportunity from each opponent that threatens you, including the defender. (If you have the Improved Bull Rush feat, you don't provoke an attack of opportunity from the defender.) Any attack of opportunity made by anyone other than the defender against you during a bull rush has a 25% chance of accidentally targeting the defender instead, and any attack of opportunity by anyone other than you against the defender likewise has a 25% chance of accidentally targeting you. (When someone makes an attack of opportunity, make the attack roll and then roll to see whether the attack went astray.)</p>
<p>Second, you and the defender make opposed Strength checks. You each add a +4 bonus for each size category you are larger than Medium or a -4 penalty for each size category you are smaller than Medium. You get a +2 bonus if you are charging. The defender gets a +4 bonus if he has more than two legs or is otherwise exceptionally stable.</p>
<p><strong>Bull Rush Results:</strong> If you beat the defender's Strength check result, you push him back 5 feet. If you wish to move with the defender, you can push him back an additional 5 feet for each 5 points by which your check result is greater than the defender's check result. You can't, however, exceed your normal movement limit. (<em>Note:</em> The defender provokes attacks of opportunity if he is moved. So do you, if you move with him. The two of you do not provoke attacks of opportunity from each other, however.)</p>
<p>If you fail to beat the defender's Strength check result, you move 5 feet straight back to where you were before you moved into his space. If that space is occupied, you fall prone in that space.</p>

<h4 id="charge">Charge</h4>
<p>Charging is a special full-round action that allows you to move up to twice your speed and attack during the action. However, it carries tight restrictions on how you can move.</p>
<p><strong>Movement During a Charge:</strong> You must move before your attack, not after. You must move at least 10 feet (2 squares) and may move up to double your speed directly toward the designated opponent.</p>
<p>You must have a clear path toward the opponent, and nothing can hinder your movement (such as difficult terrain or obstacles). Here's what it means to have a clear path. First, you must move to the closest space from which you can attack the opponent. (If this space is occupied or otherwise blocked, you can't charge.) Second, if any line from your starting space to the ending space passes through a square that blocks movement, slows movement, or contains a creature (even an ally), you can't charge. (Helpless creatures don't stop a charge.)</p>
<p>If you don't have line of sight to the opponent at the start of your turn, you can't charge that opponent.</p>
<p>You can't take a 5-foot step in the same round as a charge.</p>
<p>If you are able to take only a standard action or a move action on your turn, you can still charge, but you are only allowed to move up to your speed (instead of up to double your speed). You can't use this option unless you are restricted to taking only a standard action or move action on your turn.</p>
<p><strong>Attacking on a Charge:</strong> After moving, you may make a single melee attack. You get a +2 bonus on the attack roll. and take a -2 penalty to your AC until the start of your next turn.</p>
<p>A charging character gets a +2 bonus on the Strength check made to bull rush an opponent (see Bull Rush, above).</p>
<p>Even if you have extra attacks, such as from having a high enough base attack bonus or from using multiple weapons, you only get to make one attack during a charge.</p>
<p><strong>Lances and Charge Attacks:</strong> A lance deals double damage if employed by a mounted character in a charge.</p>
<p><strong>Weapons Readied against a Charge:</strong> Spears, tridents, and certain other piercing weapons deal double damage when readied (set) and used against a charging character.</p>

<h4 id="disarm">Disarm</h4>
<p>As a melee attack, you may attempt to disarm your opponent. If you do so with a weapon, you knock the opponent's weapon out of his hands and to the ground. If you attempt the disarm while unarmed, you end up with the weapon in your hand.</p>
<p>If you're attempting to disarm a melee weapon, follow the steps outlined here. If the item you are attempting to disarm isn't a melee weapon the defender may still oppose you with an attack roll, but takes a penalty and can't attempt to disarm you in return if your attempt fails.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Attack of Opportunity. You provoke an attack of opportunity from the target you are trying to disarm. (If you have the Improved Disarm feat, you don't incur an attack of opportunity for making a disarm attempt.) If the defender's attack of opportunity deals any damage, your disarm attempt fails.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Opposed Rolls. You and the defender make opposed attack rolls with your respective weapons. The wielder of a two-handed weapon on a disarm attempt gets a +4 bonus on this roll, and the wielder of a light weapon takes a -4 penalty. (An unarmed strike is considered a light weapon, so you always take a penalty when trying to disarm an opponent by using an unarmed strike.) If the combatants are of different sizes, the larger combatant gets a bonus on the attack roll of +4 per difference in size category. If the targeted item isn't a melee weapon, the defender takes a -4 penalty on the roll.</p>
<p><strong>Step Three:</strong> Consequences. If you beat the defender, the defender is disarmed. If you attempted the disarm action unarmed, you now have the weapon. If you were armed, the defender's weapon is on the ground in the defender's square.</p>
<p>If you fail on the disarm attempt, the defender may immediately react and attempt to disarm you with the same sort of opposed melee attack roll. His attempt does not provoke an attack of opportunity from you. If he fails his disarm attempt, you do not subsequently get a free disarm attempt against him.</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> A defender wearing spiked gauntlets can't be disarmed. A defender using a weapon attached to a locked gauntlet gets a +10 bonus to resist being disarmed.</p>
<h5 id="grabbing-items">Grabbing Items</h5>
<p>You can use a disarm action to snatch an item worn by the target. If you want to have the item in your hand, the disarm must be made as an unarmed attack.</p>
<p>If the item is poorly secured or otherwise easy to snatch or cut away the attacker gets a +4 bonus. Unlike on a normal disarm attempt, failing the attempt doesn't allow the defender to attempt to disarm you. This otherwise functions identically to a disarm attempt, as noted above.</p>
<p>You can't snatch an item that is well secured unless you have pinned the wearer (see Grapple). Even then, the defender gains a +4 bonus on his roll to resist the attempt.</p>

<h4 id="feint">Feint</h4>
<p>Feinting is a standard action. To feint, make a Bluff check opposed by a Sense Motive check by your target. The target may add his base attack bonus to this Sense Motive check. If your Bluff check result exceeds your target's Sense Motive check result, the next melee attack you make against the target does not allow him to use his Dexterity bonus to AC (if any). This attack must be made on or before your next turn.</p>
<p>When feinting in this way against a nonhumanoid you take a -4 penalty. Against a creature of animal Intelligence (1 or 2), you take a -8 penalty. Against a nonintelligent creature, it's impossible.</p>
<p>Feinting in combat does not provoke attacks of opportunity.</p>
<p><strong>Feinting as a Move Action:</strong> With the Improved Feint feat, you can attempt a feint as a move action instead of as a standard action.</p>

<h4 id="grapple">Grapple</h4>
<h5 id="grapple-checks">Grapple Checks</h5>
<p>Repeatedly in a grapple, you need to make opposed grapple checks against an opponent. A grapple check is like a melee attack roll. Your attack bonus on a grapple check is: Base attack bonus + Strength modifier + special size modifier</p>
<p><strong>Special Size Modifier:</strong> The special size modifier for a grapple check is as follows: Colossal +16, Gargantuan +12, Huge +8, Large +4, Medium +0, Small -4, Tiny -8, Diminutive -12, Fine -16. Use this number in place of the normal size modifier you use when making an attack roll.</p>
<h5 id="starting-a-grapple">Starting a Grapple</h5>
<p>To start a grapple, you need to grab and hold your target. Starting a grapple requires a successful melee attack roll. If you get multiple attacks, you can attempt to start a grapple multiple times (at successively lower base attack bonuses).</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Attack of Opportunity. You provoke an attack of opportunity from the target you are trying to grapple. If the attack of opportunity deals damage, the grapple attempt fails. (Certain monsters do not provoke attacks of opportunity when they attempt to grapple, nor do characters with the Improved Grapple feat.) If the attack of opportunity misses or fails to deal damage, proceed to Step 2.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Grab. You make a melee touch attack to grab the target. If you fail to hit the target, the grapple attempt fails. If you succeed, proceed to Step 3.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Hold. Make an opposed grapple check as a free action.</p>
<p>If you succeed, you and your target are now grappling, and you deal damage to the target as if with an unarmed strike.</p>
<p>If you lose, you fail to start the grapple. You automatically lose an attempt to hold if the target is two or more size categories larger than you are.</p>
<p>In case of a tie, the combatant with the higher grapple check modifier wins. If this is a tie, roll again to break the tie.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Maintain Grapple. To maintain the grapple for later rounds, you must move into the target's space. (This movement is free and doesn't count as part of your movement in the round.)</p>
<p>Moving, as normal, provokes attacks of opportunity from threatening opponents, but not from your target.</p>
<p>If you can't move into your target's space, you can't maintain the grapple and must immediately let go of the target. To grapple again, you must begin at Step 1.</p>
<h5 id="grappling-consequences">Grappling Consequences</h5>
<p>While you're grappling, your ability to attack others and defend yourself is limited.</p>
<p><strong>No Threatened Squares:</strong> You don't threaten any squares while grappling.</p>
<p><strong>No Dexterity Bonus:</strong> You lose your Dexterity bonus to AC (if you have one) against opponents you aren't grappling. (You can still use it against opponents you are grappling.)</p>
<p><strong>No Movement:</strong> You can't move normally while grappling. You may, however, make an opposed grapple check (see below) to move while grappling.</p>
<h5 id="if-youre-grappling">If You're Grappling</h5>
<p>When you are grappling (regardless of who started the grapple), you can perform any of the following actions. Some of these actions take the place of an attack (rather than being a standard action or a move action). If your base attack bonus allows you multiple attacks, you can attempt one of these actions in place of each of your attacks, but at successively lower base attack bonuses.</p>
<p><strong>Activate a Magic Item:</strong> You can activate a magic item, as long as the item doesn't require a spell completion trigger. You don't need to make a grapple check to activate the item.</p>
<p><strong>Attack Your Opponent:</strong> You can make an attack with an unarmed strike, natural weapon, or light weapon against another character you are grappling. You take a -4 penalty on such attacks.</p>
<p>You can't attack with two weapons while grappling, even if both are light weapons.</p>
<p><strong>Cast a Spell:</strong> You can attempt to cast a spell while grappling or even while pinned (see below), provided its casting time is no more than 1 standard action, it has no somatic component, and you have in hand any material components or focuses you might need. Any spell that requires precise and careful action is impossible to cast while grappling or being pinned. If the spell is one that you can cast while grappling, you must make a Concentration check (DC 20 + spell level) or lose the spell. You don't have to make a successful grapple check to cast the spell.</p>
<p><strong>Damage Your Opponent:</strong> While grappling, you can deal damage to your opponent equivalent to an unarmed strike. Make an opposed grapple check in place of an attack. If you win, you deal nonlethal damage as normal for your unarmed strike (1d3 points for Medium attackers or 1d2 points for Small attackers, plus Strength modifiers). If you want to deal lethal damage, you take a -4 penalty on your grapple check.</p>
<p><em>Exception:</em> Monks deal more damage on an unarmed strike than other characters, and the damage is lethal. However, they can choose to deal their damage as nonlethal damage when grappling without taking the usual -4 penalty for changing lethal damage to nonlethal damage.</p>
<p><strong>Draw a Light Weapon:</strong> You can draw a light weapon as a move action with a successful grapple check.</p>
<p><strong>Escape from Grapple:</strong> You can escape a grapple by winning an opposed grapple check in place of making an attack. You can make an Escape Artist check in place of your grapple check if you so desire, but this requires a standard action. If more than one opponent is grappling you, your grapple check result has to beat all their individual check results to escape. (Opponents don't have to try to hold you if they don't want to.) If you escape, you finish the action by moving into any space adjacent to your opponent(s).</p>
<p><strong>Move:</strong> You can move half your speed (bringing all others engaged in the grapple with you) by winning an opposed grapple check. This requires a standard action, and you must beat all the other individual check results to move the grapple.</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> You get a +4 bonus on your grapple check to move a pinned opponent, but only if no one else is involved in the grapple.</p>
<p><strong>Retrieve a Spell Component:</strong> You can produce a spell component from your pouch while grappling by using a full-round action. Doing so does not require a successful grapple check.</p>
<p><strong>Pin Your Opponent:</strong> You can hold your opponent immobile for 1 round by winning an opposed grapple check (made in place of an attack). Once you have an opponent pinned, you have a few options available to you (see below).</p>
<p><strong>Break Another's Pin:</strong> If you are grappling an opponent who has another character pinned, you can make an opposed grapple check in place of an attack. If you win, you break the hold that the opponent has over the other character. The character is still grappling, but is no longer pinned.</p>
<p><strong>Use Opponent's Weapon:</strong> If your opponent is holding a light weapon, you can use it to attack him. Make an opposed grapple check (in place of an attack). If you win, make an attack roll with the weapon with a -4 penalty (doing this doesn't require another action).</p>
<p>You don't gain possession of the weapon by performing this action.</p>
<h5 id="pinning-an-opponent">If You're Pinning an Opponent</h5>
<p>You can attempt to damage your opponent with an opposed grapple check, you can attempt to use your opponent's weapon against him, or you can attempt to move the grapple (all described above). At your option, you can prevent a pinned opponent from speaking.</p>
<p>You can use a disarm action to remove or grab away a well secured object worn by a pinned opponent, but he gets a +4 bonus on his roll to resist your attempt (see Disarm).</p>
<p>You may voluntarily release a pinned character as a free action; if you do so, you are no longer considered to be grappling that character (and vice versa).</p>
<p>You can't draw or use a weapon (against the pinned character or any other character), escape another's grapple, retrieve a spell component, pin another character, or break another's pin while you are pinning an opponent.</p>
<h5 id="pinned-by-an-opponent">If You're Pinned by an Opponent</h5>
<p>When an opponent has pinned you, you are held immobile (but not helpless) for 1 round. While you're pinned, you take a -4 penalty to your AC against opponents other than the one pinning you. At your opponent's option, you may also be unable to speak. On your turn, you can try to escape the pin by making an opposed grapple check in place of an attack. You can make an Escape Artist check in place of your grapple check if you want, but this requires a standard action. If you win, you escape the pin, but you're still grappling.</p>
<h5 id="joining-a-grapple">Joining a Grapple</h5>
<p>If your target is already grappling someone else, you can use an attack to start a grapple, as above, except that the target doesn't get an attack of opportunity against you, and your grab automatically succeeds. You still have to make a successful opposed grapple check to become part of the grapple.</p>
<p>If there are multiple opponents involved in the grapple, you pick one to make the opposed grapple check against.</p>
<h5 id="multiple-grapplers">Multiple Grapplers</h5>
<p>Several combatants can be in a single grapple. Up to four combatants can grapple a single opponent in a given round. Creatures that are one or more size categories smaller than you count for half, creatures that are one size category larger than you count double, and creatures two or more size categories larger count quadruple.</p>
<p>When you are grappling with multiple opponents, you choose one opponent to make an opposed check against. The exception is an attempt to escape from the grapple; to successfully escape, your grapple check must beat the check results of each opponent.</p>

<h4 id="mounted-combat">Mounted Combat</h4>
<p><strong>Horses in Combat:</strong> Warhorses and warponies can serve readily as combat steeds. Light horses, ponies, and heavy horses, however, are frightened by combat. If you don't dismount, you must make a DC 20 Ride check each round as a move action to control such a horse. If you succeed, you can perform a standard action after the move action. If you fail, the move action becomes a full round action and you can't do anything else until your next turn.</p>
<p>Your mount acts on your initiative count as you direct it. You move at its speed, but the mount uses its action to move.</p>
<p>A horse (not a pony) is a Large creature and thus takes up a space 10 feet (2 squares) across. For simplicity, assume that you share your mount's space during combat.</p>
<p><strong>Combat while Mounted:</strong> With a DC 5 Ride check, you can guide your mount with your knees so as to use both hands to attack or defend yourself. This is a free action.</p>
<p>When you attack a creature smaller than your mount that is on foot, you get the +1 bonus on melee attacks for being on higher ground. If your mount moves more than 5 feet, you can only make a single melee attack. Essentially, you have to wait until the mount gets to your enemy before attacking, so you can't make a full attack. Even at your mount's full speed, you don't take any penalty on melee attacks while mounted.</p>
<p>If your mount charges, you also take the AC penalty associated with a charge. If you make an attack at the end of the charge, you receive the bonus gained from the charge. When charging on horseback, you deal double damage with a lance (see Charge).</p>
<p>You can use ranged weapons while your mount is taking a double move, but at a -4 penalty on the attack roll. You can use ranged weapons while your mount is running (quadruple speed), at a -8 penalty. In either case, you make the attack roll when your mount has completed half its movement. You can make a full attack with a ranged weapon while your mount is moving. Likewise, you can take move actions normally</p>
<p><strong>Casting Spells while Mounted:</strong> You can cast a spell normally if your mount moves up to a normal move (its speed) either before or after you cast. If you have your mount move both before and after you cast a spell, then you're casting the spell while the mount is moving, and you have to make a Concentration check due to the vigorous motion (DC 10 + spell level) or lose the spell. If the mount is running (quadruple speed), you can cast a spell when your mount has moved up to twice its speed, but your Concentration check is more difficult due to the violent motion (DC 15 + spell level).</p>
<p><strong>If Your Mount Falls in Battle:</strong> If your mount falls, you have to succeed on a DC 15 Ride check to make a soft fall and take no damage. If the check fails, you take 1d6 points of damage.</p>
<p><strong>If You Are Dropped:</strong> If you are knocked unconscious, you have a 50% chance to stay in the saddle (or 75% if you're in a military saddle). Otherwise you fall and take 1d6 points of damage.</p>
<p>Without you to guide it, your mount avoids combat.</p>

<h4 id="overrun">Overrun</h4>
<p>You can attempt an overrun as a standard action taken during your move. (In general, you cannot take a standard action during a move; this is an exception.) With an overrun, you attempt to plow past or over your opponent (and move through his square) as you move. You can only overrun an opponent who is one size category larger than you, the same size, or smaller. You can make only one overrun attempt per round.</p>
<p>If you're attempting to overrun an opponent, follow these steps.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Attack of Opportunity. Since you begin the overrun by moving into the defender's space, you provoke an attack of opportunity from the defender.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Opponent Avoids? The defender has the option to simply avoid you. If he avoids you, he doesn't suffer any ill effect and you may keep moving (You can always move through a square occupied by someone who lets you by.) The overrun attempt doesn't count against your actions this round (except for any movement required to enter the opponent's square). If your opponent doesn't avoid you, move to Step 3.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Opponent Blocks? If your opponent blocks you, make a Strength check opposed by the defender's Dexterity or Strength check (whichever ability score has the higher modifier). A combatant gets a +4 bonus on the check for every size category he is larger than Medium or a -4 penalty for every size category he is smaller than Medium. The defender gets a +4 bonus on his check if he has more than two legs or is otherwise more stable than a normal humanoid. If you win, you knock the defender prone. If you lose, the defender may immediately react and make a Strength check opposed by your Dexterity or Strength check (including the size modifiers noted above, but no other modifiers) to try to knock you prone.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Consequences. If you succeed in knocking your opponent prone, you can continue your movement as normal. If you fail and are knocked prone in turn, you have to move 5 feet back the way you came and fall prone, ending your movement there. If you fail but are not knocked prone, you have to move 5 feet back the way you came, ending your movement there. If that square is occupied, you fall prone in that square.</p>
<p><strong>Improved Overrun:</strong> If you have the Improved Overrun feat, your target may not choose to avoid you.</p>
<p><strong>Mounted Overrun (Trample):</strong> If you attempt an overrun while mounted, your mount makes the Strength check to determine the success or failure of the overrun attack (and applies its size modifier, rather than yours). If you have the Trample feat and attempt an overrun while mounted, your target may not choose to avoid you, and if you knock your opponent prone with the overrun, your mount may make one hoof attack against your opponent.</p>

<h4 id="sap-knockout">Sap Knockout</h4>
<p>If a character studies his target for 3 rounds and then makes a sneak attack with a sap and hits, the attack has the additional effect of possibly knocking the target unconscious. While studying the target, the character can undertake other actions so long as his attention stays focused on the target and the target does not detect the character or recognize the character as an enemy. If the target of such an attack fails a Fortitude save (DC character's class level + 1 per d6 of sneak attack or similar class feature) against the knockout effect, she falls unconscious. The target is rendered helpless and unable to act for 1d6 minutes plus 1 minute per level of the character. If the target receives 1 point of healing (such as from a cure spell), they are woken up, but take a -2 to all actions for the next 3d6 minutes. If the target's saving throw succeeds, the attack is just a normal sneak attack. Once the character has completed the 3 rounds of study, he must make the knockout attack within the next 3 rounds.</p>
<p>If a knockout attack is attempted and fails (the target makes her save) or if the character does not launch the attack within 3 rounds of completing the study, 3 new rounds of study are required before he can attempt another knockout attack.</p>

<h4 id="sunder">Sunder</h4>
<p>You can use a melee attack with a slashing or bludgeoning weapon to strike a weapon or shield that your opponent is holding. If you're attempting to sunder a weapon or shield, follow the steps outlined here. (Attacking held objects other than weapons or shields is covered below.)</p>

<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Attack of Opportunity. You provoke an attack of opportunity from the target whose weapon or shield you are trying to sunder. (If you have the Improved Sunder feat, you don't incur an attack of opportunity for making the attempt.)</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Opposed Rolls. You and the defender make opposed attack rolls with your respective weapons. The wielder of a two-handed weapon on a sunder attempt gets a +4 bonus on this roll, and the wielder of a light weapon takes a -4 penalty. If the combatants are of different sizes, the larger combatant gets a bonus on the attack roll of +4 per difference in size category.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Consequences. If you beat the defender, roll damage and deal it to the weapon or shield. See Table: Common Armor, Weapon, and Shield Hardness and Hit Points to determine how much damage you must deal to destroy the weapon or shield.</p>
<p>If you fail the sunder attempt, you don't deal any damage.</p>
<p><em>Sundering a Carried or Worn Object:</em> You don't use an opposed attack roll to damage a carried or worn object. Instead, just make an attack roll against the object's AC. A carried or worn object's AC is equal to 10 + its size modifier + the Dexterity modifier of the carrying or wearing character. Attacking a carried or worn object provokes an attack of opportunity just as attacking a held object does. To attempt to snatch away an item worn by a defender rather than damage it, see Disarm. You can't sunder armor worn by another character.</p>

<h4 id="throw-splash-weapon">Throw Splash Weapon</h4>
<p>A splash weapon is a ranged weapon that breaks on impact, splashing or scattering its contents over its target and nearby creatures or objects. To attack with a splash weapon, make a ranged touch attack against the target. Thrown weapons require no weapon proficiency, so you don't take the -4 nonproficiency penalty. A hit deals direct hit damage to the target, and splash damage to all creatures within 5 feet of the target.</p>
<p>You can instead target a specific grid intersection. Treat this as a ranged attack against AC 5. However, if you target a grid intersection, creatures in all adjacent squares are dealt the splash damage, and the direct hit damage is not dealt to any creature. (You can't target a grid intersection occupied by a creature, such as a Large or larger creature; in this case, you're aiming at the creature.)</p>
<p>If you miss the target (whether aiming at a creature or a grid intersection), roll 1d8. This determines the misdirection of the throw, with 1 being straight back at you and 2 through 8 counting clockwise around the grid intersection or target creature. Then, count a number of squares in the indicated direction equal to the range increment of the throw.</p>
<p>After you determine where the weapon landed, it deals splash damage to all creatures in adjacent squares.</p>

<h4 id="trip">Trip</h4>
<p>You can try to trip an opponent as an unarmed melee attack. You can only trip an opponent who is one size category larger than you, the same size, or smaller.</p>
<p><strong>Making a Trip Attack:</strong> Make an unarmed melee touch attack against your target. This provokes an attack of opportunity from your target as normal for unarmed attacks.</p>
<p>If your attack succeeds, make a Strength check opposed by the defender's Dexterity or Strength check (whichever ability score has the higher modifier). A combatant gets a +4 bonus for every size category he is larger than Medium or a -4 penalty for every size category he is smaller than Medium. The defender gets a +4 bonus on his check if he has more than two legs or is otherwise more stable than a normal humanoid. If you win, you trip the defender. If you lose, the defender may immediately react and make a Strength check opposed by your Dexterity or Strength check to try to trip you.</p>
<p><em>Avoiding Attacks of Opportunity:</em> If you have the Improved Trip feat, or if you are tripping with a weapon (see below), you don't provoke an attack of opportunity for making a trip attack.</p>
<p><strong>Being Tripped (Prone):</strong> A tripped character is prone. Standing up is a move action.</p>
<p><strong>Tripping a Mounted Opponent:</strong> You may make a trip attack against a mounted opponent. The defender may make a Ride check in place of his Dexterity or Strength check. If you succeed, you pull the rider from his mount.</p>
<p><strong>Tripping with a Weapon:</strong> Some weapons can be used to make trip attacks. In this case, you make a melee touch attack with the weapon instead of an unarmed melee touch attack, and you don't provoke an attack of opportunity.</p>
<p>If you are tripped during your own trip attempt, you can drop the weapon to avoid being tripped.</p>

<h4 id="turn-rebuke-undead">Turn or Rebuke Undead</h4>
<p>A cleric may attempt to turn or rebuke undead a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. </p>

<p>Good clerics and paladins and some neutral clerics can channel positive energy, which can halt, drive off (rout), or destroy undead.</p>
<p>Evil clerics and some neutral clerics can channel negative energy, which can halt, awe (rebuke), control (command), or bolster undead.</p>
<p>Regardless of the effect, the general term for the activity is "turning." When attempting to exercise their divine control over these creatures, characters make turning checks.</p>
<h5 id="turning-checks">Turning Checks</h5>
<p>Turning undead is a supernatural ability that a character can perform as a standard action. It does not provoke attacks of opportunity.</p>
<p>You must present your holy symbol to turn undead. Turning is considered an attack.</p>
<p><strong>Times per Day:</strong> You may attempt to turn undead a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier. You can increase this number by taking the Extra Turning feat.</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> You turn the closest turnable undead first, and you can't turn undead that are more than 60 feet away or that have total cover relative to you. You don't need line of sight to a target, but you do need line of effect.</p>
<p><strong>Turning Check:</strong> The first thing you do is roll a turning check to see how powerful an undead creature you can turn. This is a Charisma check (1d20 + your Charisma modifier). Table: Turning Undead gives you the Hit Dice of the most powerful undead you can affect, relative to your level. On a given turning attempt, you can turn no undead creature whose Hit Dice exceed the result on this table.</p>
<p>A cleric with 5 or more ranks in <em>knowledge (religion)</em> gets a +2 (or higher) bonus on the DC for his turning checks against undead (see <a href="{{ site.url }}/game-rules/skills-feats/basics/#skill-synergy">Skill Synergy</a>). <em>Note:</em> This bonus is only applied to the Hit Dice of the undead you can affect. It does not affect the amount of damage you do with your turning check.</p>
<p><strong>Turning Damage:</strong> If your roll on Table: Turning Undead is high enough to let you turn at least some of the undead within 60 feet, roll 1d6 / cleric level for damage. All affected undead in the area within 60 ft. must make a Will save vs a DC of 10 + your cleric level + your Charisma modifier for half damage. Undead with turn resistance may add that bonus to this save. Any undead reduced to 0 or fewer hit points are destroyed. If an undead takes damage equal to or greater than &#189; its current remaining hit points, it is considered turned and acts accordingly.</p>
<p>If your Charisma score is average or low, it's possible to roll fewer Hit Dice of undead turned than indicated on Table: Turning Undead.</p>
<p>You may skip over already turned undead that are still within range, so that you do not waste your turning capacity on them.</p>
<p><strong>Effect and Duration of Turning:</strong> Turned undead flee from you by the best and fastest means available to them. They flee for 10 rounds (1 minute). If they cannot flee, they cower (giving any attack rolls against them a +2 bonus). If you approach within 10 feet of them, however, they overcome being turned and act normally. (You can stand within 10 feet without breaking the turning effect &ndash; you just can't approach them.) You can attack them with ranged attacks (from at least 10 feet away), and others can attack them in any fashion, without breaking the turning effect.</p>
<p><strong>Destroying Undead:</strong> If you have twice as many levels (or more) as the undead have Hit Dice, you destroy any that you would normally turn.</p>

<h5 id="evil-clerics-and-undead">Evil Clerics and Undead</h5>
<p>Evil clerics channel negative energy to rebuke (awe) or command (control) undead rather than channeling positive energy to turn or destroy them. An evil cleric makes the equivalent of a turning check. Undead that would be turned are rebuked instead, and those that would be destroyed are commanded.</p>
<p><strong>Rebuked:</strong> The cleric makes a Rebuke attempt. All affected undead within 60 ft. of the cleric must make a Will save vs a DC of 10 + your cleric level + your Charisma modifier or cower as if in awe for 10 rounds. Undead with turn resistance may add that bonus to this save. Attacks against cowering undead gain a +2 on their attack rolls.</p>
<p><strong>Commanded:</strong> To command undead, an evil cleric (or neutral cleric who has chosen to rebuke rather than turn undead) must make a turn attempt. All undead in the area of effect must make a Will save vs a DC of 10 + your cleric level + your Charisma modifier. Undead with turn resistance may add that bonus to this save. Intelligent undead may also add their Intelligence modifier (if positive) to the save. Any undead failing the save is commanded by the cleric.</p>
<p>A commanded undead creature is under the mental control of the evil cleric. The cleric must take a standard action to give mental orders to a commanded undead. At any one time, the cleric may command any number of undead whose total Hit Dice do not exceed his level. He may voluntarily relinquish command on any commanded undead creature or creatures in order to command new ones.</p>
<p><strong>Bolstering Undead:</strong> An evil cleric may also bolster undead creatures against turning in advance. An evil cleric may spend a turn attempt to bolster undead within a 60 ft. radius against turning. For each turn attempt the cleric spends, all undead in the area gain turn resistance +1, or have their turn resistance increased by 1. The cleric may not increase any particular undead creature's turn resistance by more than +3 with this ability. The bolstering lasts 10 rounds. An evil undead cleric can bolster himself in this manner.</p>
<h5 id="neutral-clerics-and-undead">Neutral Clerics and Undead</h5>
<p>A cleric of neutral alignment can either turn undead but not rebuke them, or rebuke undead but not turn them. See Turn or Rebuke Undead for more information.</p>
<p>Even if a cleric is neutral, channeling positive energy is a good act and channeling negative energy is evil.</p>
<h5 id="paladins-and-undead">Paladins and Undead</h5>
<p>Beginning at 4th level, paladins can turn undead as if they were clerics of three levels lower than they actually are.</p>
<h5 id="dispelling-turning">Dispelling Turning Attempts</h5>
<p>If an evil cleric (or neutral cleric who has chosen to rebuke rather than turn undead) wishes to dispel a turn attempt made by another cleric, he must make an opposed turn check. He rolls 1d6 / cleric level. If his total is higher than the original turn check, the turn attempt fails. If he rolls lower, or the two values are the same, the turn check succeeds, and undead in the area of effect must save for half damage.</p>
<p>If a good cleric wishes to dispel a rebuke, command, or bolster attempt made by an evil cleric (or neutral cleric who has chosen to rebuke rather than turn undead), both clerics roll 1d6 / cleric level. If the good cleric's total is higher than his opponent's total, the dispel is successful. Otherwise, the opposing cleric's attempt is made normally.</p>
<h5 id="turning-other-creatures">Turning Other Creatures</h5>
<p>Some clerics have the ability to turn creatures other than undead.</p>
<p>The turning check result is determined as normal.</p>

<h4 id="two-weapon-fighting">Two-Weapon Fighting</h4>
<p>If you wield a second weapon in your off hand, you can get one extra attack per round with that weapon. You suffer a -6 penalty with your regular attack or attacks with your primary hand and a -10 penalty to the attack with your off hand when you fight this way. You can reduce these penalties in two ways:</p>
<ul>
    <li>If your off-hand weapon is light, the penalties are reduced by 2 each. (An unarmed strike is always considered light.)</li>
    <li>The Two-Weapon Fighting feat lessens the primary hand penalty by 2, and the off-hand penalty by 6.</li>
</ul>
<p>Table: Two-Weapon Fighting Penalties summarizes the interaction of all these factors.</p>

</table>
<p><strong>Double Weapons:</strong> You can use a double weapon to make an extra attack with the off-hand end of the weapon as if you were fighting with two weapons. The penalties apply as if the off-hand end of the weapon were a light weapon.</p>
<p><strong>Thrown Weapons:</strong> The same rules apply when you throw a weapon from each hand. Treat a dart or shuriken as a light weapon when used in this manner, and treat a bolas, javelin, net, or sling as a one-handed weapon.</p>
