    The following are class features of the Union Sentinel prestige class.
    **Weapon and Armor Proficiency:** Union Sentinels are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, all armor, and all shields.
    **_Sending_ (Sp):** At 1st level, the Union Sentinel gains the use of the _sending_ spell as a spell-like ability once per day, plus one additional time per day every seven levels thereafter. This ability functions as the spell cast by a 15th-level caster.
    **_Shield of Law_ (Sp):** At 1st level, the Union Sentinel gains the use of the _shield of law_ spell as a spell-like ability once per day, plus one additional time per day every three levels thereafter. This ability functions as the spell cast by a 15th-level caster.
    **_Freedom_ (Sp):** At 2nd level, the Union Sentinel gains the use of the _freedom_ spell as a spell-like ability once per day, plus one additional time per day every six levels thereafter. This ability functions as the spell cast by an 18th-level caster.
    **_Knock_ (Sp):** At 2nd level, the Union Sentinel gains the use of the _knock_ spell as a spell-like ability once per day, plus one additional time per day every four levels thereafter. This ability functions as the spell cast by a 15th-level caster.
    **_Dimensional Anchor_ (Sp):** At 3rd level, the Union Sentinel gains the use of the _dimensional anchor_ spell as a spell-like ability once per day, plus one additional time per day every three levels thereafter. This ability functions as the spell cast by a 15th-level caster.

The Union Sentinel can defend him or herself and use any of his or her other abilities normally, as long as he or she remains adjacent to the blocked portal. This ability only functions against portals and the _gate_ spell, not against creatures with other spell-like or supernatural interplanar traveling abilities.
