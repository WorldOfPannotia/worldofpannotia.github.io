    **Hit Die:** d4.
    **Skill Points at Each Additional Level:** 2 + Int modifier.
    **Powers:** The psion's manifester level is equal to his class level. The psion's base power points do not increase after 20th level. Each time the psion attains a new level, he learns two new powers of any level or levels that he can manifest.
    **Psicrystal:** The epic psion's psicrystal, if he has one, continues to increase in power. At every odd-numbered level higher than 20th (21st, 23rd, and so on) the psicrystal's natural armor bonus and Intelligence each increase by 1. The psicrystal's power resistance is equal to the master's level + 5. At 21st level and again every ten levels higher than 21st, the psicrystal gains the benefit of the Psicrystal Power epic feat for a power of its master's choice.
    **Bonus Feats:** The epic psion gains a bonus feat every three levels higher than 20th (23rd, 26th, and so on).

    <h4>Psicrystals at Epic Level</h4>
    Special abilities granted to a psycrystal continue to grow as the level of its master increases beyond 20th, as shown on Table: Epic Psicrystal Special Abilities. Even though the table shows advancement only to 42nd level, that is not the limit. The patterns in the table continue infinitely. Psicrystal special abilities gained at less than 20th level also continue to improve.
    _Psicrystal Power:_ The psicrystal gains the benefit of the Psicrystal Power epic feat for the power its master chooses.
