    <p><strong>Spells:</strong> The epic loremaster's caster level increases by 1 per level gained above 10th.

    <p><strong>Secret:</strong> The loremaster doesn't gain additional secrets after 10th level, because there is a limit to the number of secrets that can be gained, but the character can choose a lore-master secret instead of a bonus feat. Remember that a character can't select the same secret twice.</p>
    <p><strong>Lore:</strong> Add the loremaster's class level + Intelligence modifier to all lore checks, as normal.</p>
    <p><strong>Bonus Feats:</strong> The epic loremaster gains a bonus feat (selected from the list of epic loremaster feats) every three levels after 10th.</p>
