        <p class="noindent">**Blindsight (Ex):** Grimlocks can sense all foes within 40 feet as a sighted creature would. Beyond that range, they treat all targets as having total concealment.
        <p class="noindent">Grimlocks are susceptible to sound- and scent-based attacks, however, and are affected normally by loud noises and sonic spells (such as ghost sound or silence) and overpowering odors (such as stinking cloud or incense-heavy air). Negating a grimlock's sense of smell or hearing reduces this ability to normal ~Blind-Fight (as the feat). If both these senses are negated, a grimlock is effectively blinded.
        <p class="noindent">**Immunities:** Grimlocks are immune to gaze attacks, visual effects, illusions, and other attack forms that rely on sight.
