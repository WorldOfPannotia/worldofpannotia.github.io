        <p class="noindent">**Pipes (Su):** Satyrs can play a variety of magical tunes on their pan pipes. Usually, only one satyr in a group carries pipes. When it plays, all creatures within a 60-foot spread (except satyrs) must succeed on a DC 12+Cha mod Will save or be affected by _charm person_, _fear_, or _sleep_ (caster level 10th; the satyr chooses the tune and its effect).
        <p class="noindent">In the hands of other beings, these pipes have no special powers. A creature that successfully saves against any of the pipe's effects cannot be affected by the same set of pipes for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.
