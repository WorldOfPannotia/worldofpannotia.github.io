        <h4>Racial Traits</h4>
        <ul class="racialTraits">
            <li>+2 Dexterity, -2 Strength.</li>
            <li>Small: As a Small creature, an elfling gains a +1 size bonus to Armor Class, a +1 size bonus on attack rolls, and a +4 size bonus on <em>hide</em> checks, but she uses smaller weapons than humans use, and her lifting and carrying limits are three-quarters of those of a Medium character.</li>
            <li>Low-Light Vision: An elfling can see twice as far as a human in starlight, moonlight, torchlight, and similar conditions of poor illumination. She retains the ability to distinguish color and detail under these conditions.</li>
            <li>Weapon Proficiency: Elflings receive the Martial/Simple Weapon Proficiency feats for the shortbow (including composite shortbow), sling, and thrown weapons as bonus feats.</li>
            <li>Elfling base land speed is 30 feet.</li>
            <li>An elfling receives a +2 racial bonus on <em>listen</em>, <em>move silently</em>, and <em>spot</em> checks, but does not gain the elf ability to notice secret doors within 5 ft.</li>
            <li>+1 racial bonus on all saving throws.</li>
            <li>Mixed Blood: For all effects related to race, an elfling is considered both an elf and a halfling. However, in cases where these distinctions would conflict with one another, an elfling is considered to be the more beneficial race.</li>
            <li>Automatic Languages: Common, Elven, and Halfling; Bonus Languages:  Draconic, Dwarven, Gnoll, Gnome, Goblin, Orc, and Sylvan.</li>
            <li>Favored Class: <a href="#">Rogue</a>. A multiclass elfling's rogue class does not count when determining whether she takes an experience point penalty for multiclassing.</li>
