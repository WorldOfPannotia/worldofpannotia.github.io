        <h4>Racial Traits</h4>
        <ul class="racialTraits">
             * +6 Strength, +4 Dexterity, +2 Constitution, +4 Intelligence, +4 Wisdom, +2 Charisma.
             * Medium size.

        <p class="noindent">**Change Size (Sp):** Twice per day, a janni can magically change a creature's size. This works just like an _enlarge person_ or _reduce person_ spell (the janni chooses when using the ability), except that the ability can work on the janni. A DC 12+Cha mod Fortitude save negates the effect. The save DC is Charisma-based. This is the equivalent of a 2nd-level spell.
        <p class="noindent">**Spell-Like Abilities:** 3/day-_invisibility_ (self only), _speak with animals_. Caster level 12th. Once per day a janni can _create food and water_ (caster level 7th) and can use _ethereal jaunt_ (caster level 12th) for 1 hour. The save ~DCs are Charisma-based.
        <p class="noindent">**Elemental Endurance (Ex):** Jann can survive on the Elemental Planes of Air, Earth, Fire, or Water for up to 48 hours. Failure to return to the Material Plane before that time expires causes a janni to take 1 point of damage per additional hour spent on the elemental plane, until it dies or returns to the Material Plane.
