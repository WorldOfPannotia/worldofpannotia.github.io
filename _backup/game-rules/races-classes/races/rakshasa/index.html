        <h4>Racial Traits</h4>
        <ul class="racialTraits">
             * +2 Strength, +4 Dexterity, +6 Constitution, +2 Intelligence, +2 Wisdom, +6 Charisma.
             * Medium size.
             * A rakshasa's base land speed is 40 feet.
             * Darkvision out to 60 feet.
             * Racial Skills: A rakshasa has a +4 racial bonus on _bluff_ and _disguise_ checks, and it can gain further bonuses by using change shape (+10 on _disguise_ checks) and _detect thoughts_ (+4 on _bluff_ and _disguise_ checks).
             * +9 natural armor bonus.
             * Natural Weapons: Bite (1d6) and 2 claws (1d4).
             * Detect Thoughts (Su): The save DC is 12 + the character's Cha modifier.
             * Spells: A rakshasa character casts spells as a 7th-level sorcerer. If the character takes additional levels of sorcerer, these levels stack with the rakshasa's base spellcasting ability for spells known, spells per day, and other effects dependent on caster level. A rakshasa character likewise uses the sum of its racial spellcasting levels and class levels to determine the abilities of its familiar.
             * Special Qualities: Change shape, damage reduction 15/good and piercing, spell resistance equal to 20 + class levels.
             * Automatic Languages: Common, Infernal. Bonus Languages: Sylvan, Undercommon.
             * Favored Class: Sorcerer.
             * Level adjustment +11.
        
        <p class="noindent">**Change Shape (Su):** A rakshasa can assume any humanoid form, or revert to its own form, as a standard action. In humanoid form, a rakshasa loses its claw and bite attacks (although it often equips itself with weapons and armor instead). A rakshasa remains in one form until it chooses to assume a new one. A change in form cannot be dispelled, but the rakshasa reverts to its natural form when killed. A _true seeing_ spell reveals its natural form.
        <p class="noindent">**Detect Thoughts (Su):** A rakshasa can continuously use _detect thoughts_ as the spell (caster level 7+HD; Will DC 12+Cha mod negates). It can suppress or resume this ability as a free action.
