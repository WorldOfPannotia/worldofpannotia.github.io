<h4>Description</h4>
An outsider is at least partially composed of the essence (but not necessarily the material) of some plane other than the Material Plane. Some creatures start out as some other type and become outsiders when they attain a higher (or lower) state of spiritual existence.

    <h4>Racial Features</h4>
    A(n) Outsider possesses the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature's entry).
    <ul class="racialTraits">
         * <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/specialAbilities.htm#darkvision">Darkvision</a> out to 60 feet.
         * Unlike most other living creatures, an outsider does not have a dual nature-its soul and body form one unit. When an outsider is slain, no soul is set loose. Spells that restore souls to their bodies, such as raise dead, reincarnate, and resurrection, don't work on an outsider. It takes a different magical effect, such as limited wish, wish, miracle, or true resurrection to restore it to life. An outsider with the native subtype can be raised, reincarnated, or resurrected just as other living creatures can be.
         * Proficient with all simple and martial weapons and any weapons mentioned in its entry.
         * Proficient with whatever type of armor (light, medium, or heavy) it is described as wearing, as well as all lighter types. Outsiders not indicated as wearing armor are not proficient with armor. Outsiders are proficient with shields if they are proficient with any form of armor.
         * Outsiders breathe, but do not need to eat or sleep (although they can do so if they wish). Native outsiders breathe, eat, and sleep.
