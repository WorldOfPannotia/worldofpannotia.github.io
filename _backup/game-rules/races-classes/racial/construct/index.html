    <h4>Racial Features</h4>
    A(n) Construct possesses the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature's entry).
    <ul class="racialTraits">
         * No Constitution score.
         * <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/specialAbilities.htm#lowLightVision">Low-light vision</a>.
         * <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/specialAbilities.htm#darkvision">Darkvision</a> out to 60 feet.
         * Immunity to all mind-affecting effects (charms, compulsions, phantasms, patterns, and morale effects).
         * Immunity to poison, sleep effects, paralysis, stunning, disease, death effects, and necromancy effects.
         * Cannot heal damage on their own, but often can be repaired by exposing them to a certain kind of effect (see the creature's description for details) or through the use of the Craft Construct feat. A construct with the <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/specialAbilities.htm#fastHealing">fast healing</a> special quality still benefits from that quality.
         * Not subject to critical hits, nonlethal damage, ability damage, ability drain, fatigue, exhaustion, or energy drain.
         * Immunity to any effect that requires a Fortitude save (unless the effect also works on objects, or is harmless).
         * Not at risk of death from massive damage. Immediately destroyed when reduced to 0 hit points or less.
         * Since it was never alive, a construct cannot be raised or resurrected.
         * Because its body is a mass of unliving matter, a construct is hard to destroy. It gains bonus hit points based on size, as shown on the table.
         * Proficient with its natural weapons only, unless generally humanoid in form, in which case proficient with any weapon mentioned in its entry.
         * Proficient with no armor.
         * Constructs do not eat, sleep, or breathe.
