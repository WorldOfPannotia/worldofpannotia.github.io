<h3 id="feat-desc-format">Feat Description Format</h3>
<p>Here is the format for feat descriptions.</p>

<div id="sample-feat" class="sf-box ogc">
    <h4>Feat Name [Type of feat]</h4>
    <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> A minimum ability score, another feat or feats, a minimum base attack bonus, a minimum number of ranks in one or more skills, or a class level that a character must have in order to acquire this feat. This entry is absent if a feat has no prerequisite. A feat may have more than one prerequisite.</p>
    <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> What the feat enables the character ("you" in the feat description) to do. If a character has the same feat more than once, its benefits do not stack unless indicated otherwise in the description.</p>
    <p>In general, having a feat twice is the same as having it once.</p>
    <p><strong>Normal:</strong> What a character who does not have this feat is limited to or restricted from doing. If not having the feat causes no particular drawback, this entry is absent.</p>
    <p><strong>Special:</strong> Additional facts about the feat that may be helpful when you decide whether to acquire the feat.</p>

    <article id="brew-greater-potion" class="sf-box">
        <h4>Brew Greater Potion [Item Creation]</h4>
        <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Brew Potion, the ability to cast 4th level spells.</p>
        <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You can create a potion of any 6th-level or lower spell that you know and that targets one or more creatures. This feat is otherwise identical to the Brew Potion feat.</p>
    </article>

    <article id="brew-potion" class="sf-box">
        <h4>Brew Potion [Item Creation]</h4>
        <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Caster level 3rd; or <em>craft (alchemy)</em> 4 ranks and Caster level 1st.</p>
        <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You can create a potion of any 3rd-level or lower spell that you know and that targets one or more creatures. Brewing a potion takes one hour per level of the spell you are using for the potion. When you create a potion, you set the caster level, which must be sufficient to cast the spell in question and no higher than your own level. The base price of a potion is its spell level &times; its caster level &times; 50 gp. To brew a potion, you must spend 1/25 of this base price in XP and use up raw materials costing one half this base price.</p>
        <p>When you create a potion, you make any choices that you would normally make when casting the spell. Whoever drinks the potion is the target of the spell.</p>
        <p>Any potion that stores a spell with a costly material component or an XP cost also carries a commensurate cost. In addition to the costs derived from the base price, you must expend the material component or pay the XP when creating the potion.</p>
        <p><strong>Special:</strong> For every 5 ranks you have in <em>craft (alchemy)</em>, the total time time for brewing a potion is reduced 10%, to a maximum of -50% (rounded to the nearest half-hour). This cannot reduce the time to less than one hour for a potion or batch of potions.</p>
        <p>In addition, potions may be brewed in batches. Each batch may have a maximum of 10 potions or 10,000gp worth of potions, whichever is less. Brewing potions in a batch does not increase the time it takes to brew, but it does increase the XP and raw materials costs. For every potion past the first, add &#189; of the base XP and raw material cost to the total.</p>
        <p><em>For example, a 10th-level cleric decides to brew a batch of 10 cure serious wounds potions at CL 5. The base price for these potions is 750 gp (5 &times; 3 &times; 50 gp) and the XP and raw materials cost are 30 XP and 375 gp, respectively. Each potion after the first would therefore have an XP and raw materials cost of 15 XP and 188 gp (187.5 gp, rounded up), respectively. Therefore, the batch of potions would cost the cleric a total of 165 XP ([9 &times; 15] + 30) and 2,067 gp ([9 &times; 188] + 372) and take 3 hours. If this same cleric had 13 ranks in <em>craft (alchemy)</em>, the total time would be 2.5 hours.</em></p>

    <article id="burrowing-power" class="sf-box">
        <h4>Burrowing Power [Metapsionic]</h4>
        <p>Your powers sometimes bypass barriers.</p>
        <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> To use this feat, you must expend your psionic focus. You can attempt to manifest your powers against targets that are sheltered behind a wall or force effect. Your power briefly skips through the Astral Plane to bypass the barrier.</p>
        <p>The strength and thickness of the barrier determine your chance of success. To successfully bypass the barrier with your power, you make a <em>psicraft</em> check against a DC equal to 10 + the hardness of the barrier + 1 per foot of thickness (minimum 1). Assign a hardness of 20 to barriers without a hardness rating, such as force effects (or a <em>wall of ectoplasm</em>). Force walls or <em>walls of ectoplasm</em> are assumed to have less than 1 foot of thickness unless noted otherwise.</p>
        <p>If a power requires line of sight (which includes most powers that affect a target or targets instead of an area), you cannot manifest it as a burrowing power unless you can somehow see the target, such as with <em>clairvoyant sense</em>. Using this feat increases the power point cost of the power by 2. The power's total cost cannot exceed your manifester level.</p>

    <article id="careful-aim" class="sf-box">
        <h4>Careful Aim [General][Fighter]</h4>
        <p>You can forgo multiple shots in a round to deal more damage on a single shot.</p>
        <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Point-Blank Shot, base attack bonus 6+, Wis 13</p>
        <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You can make a single careful shot as a full attack action. Your careful shot deals extra damage for every potential attack you give up. This damage is equal to the 1d8 plus any enhancement bonuses your arrow or bow has. For example, if a character has a medium size composite longbow with a strength rating of +2 and a base attack bonus of +11, he could sacrifice two of his attacks for a single attack that dealt an extra 2d8+4 damage.</p>
        <p>If the bow has magical properties, such as the flaming or expansion abilities, the damage from those abilities is not factored into the extra damage. For example, if a character has a +1 flaming composite longbow (Str +2) and sacrificed two attacks, the extra damage would be 2d8+6 (1d8+2 base damage &times; two sacrificed attacks, +1 weapon enhancement &times; two sacrificed attacks).</p>
        <p><strong>Special:</strong> A fighter may select Careful Aim as one of his fighter bonus feats.</p>

        <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You can use your spiked chain as double weapon, and you incur all the normal attack penalties associated with fighting with two weapons, just as if you were using a one-handed weapon and a light weapon. You cannot use the spiked chain as a reach weapon while using it as a double weapon, but you may switch techniques once per round as a free action.</p>

    <article id="chain-power" class="sf-box">
        <h4>Chain Power [Metapsionic]</h4>
        <p>You can manifest powers that arc to hit other targets in addition to the primary target.</p>
        <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> To use this feat, you must expend your psionic focus. You can chain any power that affects a single target and that deals either acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic damage. After the primary target is struck, the power can arc to a number of secondary targets equal to your manifester level (maximum twenty). The secondary arcs each strike one target and deal half as much damage as the primary one did (round down).</p>
        <p>Each target gets to make a saving throw, if one is allowed by the power. You choose secondary targets as you like, but they must all be within 30 feet of the primary target, and no target can be struck more than once. You can choose to affect fewer secondary targets than the maximum (to avoid allies in the area, for example).</p>

        <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> As a move-action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity, you wrap up part of your spiked chain around your forearm, allowing you to wield this weapon as a one-handed weapon. You lose the ability to strike opponents within 10 feet, but the weapon remains the same. You can still trip or disarm, but you cannot drop or let go of the chain of you fail the opposed check.

        </table>
        <p><em>Leadership Score:</em> A character's base Leadership score equals his level plus any Charisma modifier. In order to take into account negative Charisma modifiers, this table allows for very low Leadership scores, but the character must still be 6th level or higher in order to gain the Leadership feat. Outside factors can affect a character's Leadership score, as detailed above.</p>
        <p><em>Cohort Level:</em> The character can attract a cohort of up to this level. Regardless of a character's Leadership score, he can only recruit a cohort who is two or more levels lower than himself. The cohort should be equipped with gear appropriate for its level. A character can try to attract a cohort of a particular race, class, and alignment. The cohort's alignment may not be opposed to the leader's alignment on either the law-vs-chaos or good-vs-evil axis, and the leader takes a Leadership penalty if he recruits a cohort of an alignment different from his own.</p>
        <p>Cohorts earn XP as follows:</p>
        <p>The cohort does not count as a party member when determining the party's XP.</p>
        <p>Divide the cohort's level by the level of the PC with whom he or she is associated (the character with the Leadership feat who attracted the cohort).</p>
        <p>Multiply this result by the total XP awarded to the PC and add that number of experience points to the cohort's total.</p>
        <p>If a cohort gains enough XP to bring it to a level one lower than the associated PC's character level, the cohort does not gain the new level&ndash;its new XP total is 1 less than the amount needed attain the next level.</p>
        <p><em>Number of Followers by Level:</em> The character can lead up to the indicated number of characters of each level. Followers are similar to cohorts, except they're generally low-level NPCs. Because they're generally five or more levels behind the character they follow, they're rarely effective in combat.</p>
        <p>Followers don't earn experience and thus don't gain levels. However, when a character with Leadership attains a new level, the player consults the table above to determine if she has acquired more followers, some of which may be higher level than the existing followers. (You don't consult the table to see if your cohort gains levels, however, because cohorts earn experience on their own.)</p>

        <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> As a standard action, you may fire two arrows at a single opponent within 30 feet. Both arrows use the same attack roll (with a -4 penalty) to determine success and deal damage normally (but see Special).</p>
        <p>For every five points of base attack bonus you have above +6, you may add one additional arrow to this attack, to a maximum of four arrows at a base attack bonus of +16. However, each arrow after the second adds a cumulative -2 penalty on the attack roll (for a total penalty of -6 for three arrows and -8 for four).</p>
        <p>Damage reduction and other resistances apply separately against each arrow fired.</p>
        <p><strong>Special:</strong> Regardless of the number of arrows you fire, you apply precision-based damage only once. If you score a critical hit, only the first arrow fired deals critical damage; all others deal regular damage.</p>

        <p>If you fail a <em>survival</em> check, you can retry after 1 hour (outdoors) or 10 minutes (indoors) of searching.</p>
        <p><strong>Normal:</strong> Without this feat, you can use the <em>survival</em> skill to find tracks, but you can follow them only if the DC for the task is 10 or lower. Alternatively, you can use the <em>search</em> skill to find a footprint or similar sign of a creature's passage using the DCs given above, but you can't use <em>search</em> to follow tracks, even if someone else has already found them.</p>
        <p><strong>Special:</strong> A ranger automatically has Track as a bonus feat. He need not select it.</p>
        <p>This feat does not allow you to find or follow the tracks made by a subject of a <em>pass without trace</em> spell.</p>

        <h4>Trample [General][Fighter]</h4>
        <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> <em>ride</em> 1 rank, Mounted Combat.</p>
        <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> When you attempt to overrun an opponent while mounted, your target may not choose to avoid you. Your mount may make one hoof attack against any target you knock down, gaining the standard +4 bonus on attack rolls against prone targets.</p>

        <h4>Twin Power [Metapsionic]</h4>
        <p>You can manifest a power simultaneously with another power just like it.</p>
        <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> To use this feat, you must expend your psionic focus. You can twin a power. Manifesting a power altered by this feat causes the power to take effect twice on the area or target, as if you were simultaneously manifesting the same power two times on the same location or target. Any variables in the power (such as duration, number of targets, and so on) are the same for both of the resulting powers. The target experiences all the effects of both powers individually and receives a saving throw (if applicable) for each. In some cases, such as a twinned <em>psionic charm</em>, failing both saving throws results in redundant effects (although, in this example, any ally of the target would have to succeed on two dispel attempts to free the target from the charm effect).</p>
        <p>Using this feat increases the power point cost of the power by 6. The power's total cost cannot exceed your manifester level.</p>

        <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> When wielding a double weapon or two weapons (not including natural weapons or unarmed strikes), you gain a +1 shield bonus to your AC.</p>
        <p>When you are fighting defensively or using the total defense action, this shield bonus increases to +2.</p>

    <article id="two-weapon-fighting" class="sf-box">
        <h4>Two-Weapon Fighting [General][Fighter]</h4>
        <p>You can fight with a weapon in each hand. You can make one extra attack each round with the second weapon.</p>
        <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Dex 15.</p>
        <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Your penalties on attack rolls for fighting with two weapons are reduced. The penalty for your primary hand lessens by 2 and the one for your off hand lessens by 6.</p>
        <p><strong>Normal:</strong> If you wield a second weapon in your off hand, you can get one extra attack per round with that weapon. When fighting in this way you suffer a -6 penalty with your regular attack or attacks with your primary hand and a -10 penalty to the attack with your off hand. If your off-hand weapon is light the penalties are reduced by 2 each. (An unarmed strike is always considered light.)</p>
        <p><strong>Special:</strong> A 2nd-level ranger who has chosen the two-weapon combat style is treated as having Two-Weapon Fighting, even if he does not have the prerequisite for it, but only when he is wearing light or no armor.</p>

        <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Str 13, Psionic Fist, base attack bonus +5.</p>
        <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> To use this feat, you must expend your psionic focus. You can resolve your unarmed strike or attack with a natural weapon as a touch attack.</p>

        <p>Disabling conditions do not hold you back.</p>
        <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> To use this feat, you must expend your psionic focus. Your mental strength is enough to overcome some otherwise disabling conditions. You can manifest an unconditional power when you are dazed, <em>confused</em>, nauseated, shaken, or stunned.</p>
        <p>Only personal powers and powers that affect your person can be manifested as unconditional powers.</p>

    <article id="up-the-walls" class="sf-box">
        <h4>Up the Walls [Psionic]</h4>
        <p>You can run on walls for brief distances.</p>
        <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Wis 13.</p>
        <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> While you are psionically focused, you can take part of one of your move actions to traverse a wall or other relatively smooth vertical surface if you begin and end your move on a horizontal surface. The height you can achieve on the wall is limited only by this movement restriction. If you do not end your move on a horizontal surface, you fall prone, taking falling damage as appropriate for your distance above the ground. Treat the wall as a normal floor for the purpose of measuring your movement. Passing from floor to wall or wall to floor costs no movement; you can change surfaces freely. Opponents on the ground can make attacks of opportunity as you move up the wall.</p>
        <p><strong>Special:</strong> You can take other move actions in conjunction with moving along a wall. For instance, the Spring Attack feat allows you to make an attack from the wall against a foe standing on the ground who is within the area you threaten; however, if you are somehow prevented from completing your move, you fall. Likewise, you could tumble along the wall to avoid attacks of opportunity.</p>

        <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> When using a wand, you may give up one of your spells per day to cast a spell from the wand instead.
