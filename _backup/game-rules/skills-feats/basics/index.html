<h3 id="skills-summary">Skills Summary</h3>
<p>When you buy a skill, your character gets 1 rank (equal to a +1 bonus on checks with that skill) for each skill point spent.</p>
<p>Your maximum rank in a class skill is your character level + 3.</p>
<p>Your maximum rank in a cross-class skill is one-half of this number (do not round up or down).</p>
<p><strong>Using Skills:</strong> To make a skill check, roll: 1d20 + skill modifier (Skill modifier = skill rank + ability modifier + miscellaneous modifiers)</p>
<p>This roll works just like an attack roll or a saving throw&ndash; the higher the roll, the better. Either you're trying to match or exceed a certain Difficulty Class (DC), or you're trying to beat another character's check result.</p>
<p><strong>Skill Ranks:</strong> A character's number of ranks in a skill is based on how many skill points a character has invested in a skill. Many skills can be used even if the character has no ranks in them; doing this is called making an untrained skill check.</p>
<p><strong>Ability Modifier:</strong> The ability modifier used in a skill check is the modifier for the skill's key ability (the ability associated with the skill's use). The key ability of each skill is noted in its description.</p>
<p><strong>Miscellaneous Modifiers:</strong> Miscellaneous modifiers include racial bonuses, armor check penalties, and bonuses provided by feats, among others.</p>
<p>Each skill point you spend on a class skill gets you 1 rank in that skill. Class skills are the skills found on your character's class skill list. Each skill point you spend on a cross-class skill also gets your character 1 rank in that skill. Cross-class skills are skills not found on your character's class skill list. You can't save skill points to spend later.</p>
<p>The maximum rank in a class skill is the character's level + 3. If it's a cross-class skill, the maximum rank is half of that number (do not round up or down).</p>
<p>Regardless of whether a skill is purchased as a class skill or a cross-class skill, if it is a class skill for any of your classes, your maximum rank equals your total character level + 3.</p>
<h4 id="using-skills">Using Skills</h4>
<p>When your character uses a skill, you make a skill check to see how well he or she does. The higher the result of the skill check, the better. Based on the circumstances, your result must match or beat a particular number (a DC or the result of an opposed skill check) for the check to be successful. The harder the task, the higher the number you need to roll.</p>
<p>Circumstances can affect your check. A character who is free to work without distractions can make a careful attempt and avoid simple mistakes. A character who has lots of time can try over and over again, thereby assuring the best outcome. If others help, the character may succeed where otherwise he or she would fail.</p>
<h5 id="skill-checks">Skill Checks</h5>
<p>A skill check takes into account a character's training (skill rank), natural talent (ability modifier), and luck (the die roll). It may also take into account his or her race's knack for doing certain things (racial bonus) or what armor he or she is wearing (armor check penalty), or a certain feat the character possesses, among other things.</p>
<p>To make a skill check, roll 1d20 and add your character's skill modifier for that skill. The skill modifier incorporates the character's ranks in that skill and the ability modifier for that skill's key ability, plus any other miscellaneous modifiers that may apply, including racial bonuses and armor check penalties. The higher the result, the better. Unlike with attack rolls and saving throws, a natural roll of 20 on the d20 is not an automatic success, and a natural roll of 1 is not an automatic failure.</p>
<h6 id="difficulty">Difficulty Class</h6>
<p>Some checks are made against a Difficulty Class (DC). The DC is a number (set using the skill rules as a guideline) that you must score as a result on your skill check in order to succeed.</p>
<table id="difficulty-class-table" class="table table-bordered table-hover">

<h6 id="opposed-checks">Opposed Checks</h6>
<p>An opposed check is a check whose success or failure is determined by comparing the check result to another character's check result. In an opposed check, the higher result succeeds, while the lower result fails. In case of a tie, the higher skill modifier wins. If these scores are the same, roll again to break the tie.</p>

<h6 id="trying-again">Trying Again</h6>
<p>In general, you can try a skill check again if you fail, and you can keep trying indefinitely. Some skills, however, have consequences of failure that must be taken into account. A few skills are virtually useless once a check has failed on an attempt to accomplish a particular task. For most skills, when a character has succeeded once at a given task, additional successes are meaningless.</p>
<h6 id="untrained-skill-checks">Untrained Skill Checks</h6>
<p>Generally, if your character attempts to use a skill he or she does not possess, you make a skill check as normal. The skill modifier doesn't have a skill rank added in because the character has no ranks in the skill. Any other applicable modifiers, such as the modifier for the skill's key ability, are applied to the check.</p>
<p>Many skills can be used only by someone who is trained in them.</p>
<h6 id="fav-unfav-conditions">Favorable and Unfavorable Conditions</h6>
<p>Some situations may make a skill easier or harder to use, resulting in a bonus or penalty to the skill modifier for a skill check or a change to the DC of the skill check.</p>
<p>The chance of success can be altered in four ways to take into account exceptional circumstances.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Give the skill user a +2 circumstance bonus to represent conditions that improve performance, such as having the perfect tool for the job, getting help from another character (see Combining Skill Attempts), or possessing unusually accurate information.</li>
    <li>Give the skill user a –2 circumstance penalty to represent conditions that hamper performance, such as being forced to use improvised tools or having misleading information.</li>
    <li>Reduce the DC by 2 to represent circumstances that make the task easier, such as having a friendly audience or doing work that can be subpar.</li>
    <li>Increase the DC by 2 to represent circumstances that make the task harder, such as having an uncooperative audience or doing work that must be flawless.</li>
</ol>
<p>Conditions that affect your character's ability to perform the skill change the skill modifier. Conditions that modify how well the character has to perform the skill to succeed change the DC. A bonus to the skill modifier and a reduction in the check's DC have the same result: They create a better chance of success. But they represent different circumstances, and sometimes that difference is important.</p>
<h6 id="time-and-skills">Time and Skill Checks</h6>
<p>Using a skill might take a round, take no time, or take several rounds or even longer. Most skill uses are standard actions, move actions, or full-round actions. Types of actions define how long activities take to perform within the framework of a combat round (6 seconds) and how movement is treated with respect to the activity. Some skill checks are instant and represent reactions to an event, or are included as part of an action.</p>
<p>These skill checks are not actions. Other skill checks represent part of movement.</p>
<h6 id="checks-without-rolls">Checks without Rolls</h6>
<p>A skill check represents an attempt to accomplish some goal, usually while under some sort of time pressure or distraction. Sometimes, though, a character can use a skill under more favorable conditions and eliminate the luck factor.</p>
<p><strong>Taking 10: </strong>When your character is not being threatened or distracted, you may choose to take 10. Instead of rolling 1d20 for the skill check, calculate your result as if you had rolled a 10. For many routine tasks, taking 10 makes them automatically successful. Distractions or threats (such as combat) make it impossible for a character to take 10. In most cases, taking 10 is purely a safety measure &ndash;you know (or expect) that an average roll will succeed but fear that a poor roll might fail, so you elect to settle for the average roll (a 10). Taking 10 is especially useful in situations where a particularly high roll wouldn't help.</p>
<p><strong>Taking 20:</strong>When you have plenty of time (generally 2 minutes for a skill that can normally be checked in 1 round, one full-round action, or one standard action), you are faced with no threats or distractions, and the skill being attempted carries no penalties for failure, you can take 20. In other words, eventually you will get a 20 on 1d20 if you roll enough times. Instead of rolling 1d20 for the skill check, just calculate your result as if you had rolled a 20.</p>
<p>Taking 20 means you are trying until you get it right, and it assumes that you fail many times before succeeding. Taking 20 takes twenty times as long as making a single check would take.</p>
<p>Since taking 20 assumes that the character will fail many times before succeeding, if you did attempt to take 20 on a skill that carries penalties for failure, your character would automatically incur those penalties before he or she could complete the task. Common “take 20” skills include <em>escape artist</em>, <em>open lock</em>, and <em>search</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Ability Checks and Caster Level Checks:</strong> The normal take 10 and take 20 rules apply for ability checks. Neither rule applies to caster level checks.</p>
<h5 id="combining-skill-attempts">Combining Skill Attempts</h5>
<p>When more than one character tries the same skill at the same time and for the same purpose, their efforts may overlap.</p>
<h6 id="individual-events">Individual Events</h6>
<p>Often, several characters attempt some action and each succeeds or fails independently. The result of one character's <em>climb</em> check does not influence the results of other characters' <em>climb</em> checks.</p>
<h6 id="aid-another">Aid Another</h6>
<p>You can help another character achieve success on his or her skill check by making the same kind of skill check in a cooperative effort. If you roll a 10 or higher on your check, the character you are helping gets a +2 bonus to his or her check, as per the rule for favorable conditions. (You can't take 10 on a skill check to aid another.) In many cases, a character's help won't be beneficial, or only a limited number of characters can help at once.</p>
<p>In cases where the skill restricts who can achieve certain results you can't aid another to grant a bonus to a task that your character couldn't achieve alone.</p>
<h5 id="skill-synergy">Skill Synergy</h5>
<p>It's possible for a character to have two skills that work well together. In general, having 5 or more ranks in one skill gives the character a +2 bonus on skill checks with each of its synergistic skills, as noted in the skill description. In some cases, this bonus applies only to specific uses of the skill in question, and not to all checks. Some skills provide benefits on other checks made by a character, such as those checks required to use certain class features.</p>
<p>This synergy bonus increases as follows: a character will receive +2 for having a minimum of 5 ranks in the requisite skill(s), then an additional +1 for every 5 ranks beyond that (e.g. - +2 at 5 ranks, +3 at 10 ranks, +4 at 15 ranks, and so on).</p>

<h4 id="ability-checks">Ability Checks</h4>
<p>Sometimes a character tries to do something to which no specific skill really applies. In these cases, you make an ability check. An ability check is a roll of 1d20 plus the appropriate ability modifier. Essentially, you're making an untrained skill check.</p>
<p>In some cases, an action is a straight test of one's ability with no luck involved. Just as you wouldn't make a height check to see who is taller, you don't make a Strength check to see who is stronger.</p>

<h3 id="feats-summary">Feats Summary</h3>
<h4 id="feats-prereq">Prerequisites</h4>
<p>Some feats have prerequisites. Your character must have the indicated ability score, class feature, feat, skill, base attack bonus, or other quality designated in order to select or use that feat. A character can gain a feat at the same level at which he or she gains the prerequisite.</p>
<p>A character can't use a feat if he or she has lost a prerequisite.</p>
<h4 id="feat-types">Types of Feats</h4>
<p>Some feats are general, meaning that no special rules govern them as a group. Others are item creation feats, which allow spellcasters to create magic items of all sorts. A metamagic feat lets a spellcaster prepare and cast a spell with greater effect, albeit as if the spell were a higher spell level than it actually is.</p>
<h5 id="fighter-feats">Fighter Bonus Feats</h5>
<p>Any feat designated as a fighter feat can be selected as a fighter's bonus feat. This designation does not restrict characters of other classes from selecting these feats, assuming that they meet any prerequisites.</p>
<h5 id="psionic-feats">Psionic Feats</h5>
<p>Psionic feats are available only to characters and creatures with the ability to manifest powers. (In other words, they either have a power point reserve or have psi-like abilities.)</p>
<p>Because psionic feats are supernatural abilities&ndash;a departure from the general rule that feats do not grant supernatural abilities&ndash;they cannot be disrupted in combat (as powers can be) and generally do not provoke attacks of opportunity (except as noted in their descriptions). Supernatural abilities are not subject to power resistance and cannot be dispelled; however, they do not function in areas where psionics is suppressed, such as a <em>null psionics field. </em>Leaving such an area immediately allows psionic feats to be used.</p>
<p>Many psionic feats can be used only when you are psionically focused; others require you to expend your psionic focus to gain their benefit. Expending your psionic focus does not require an action; it is part of another action (such as using a feat). When you expend your psionic focus, it applies only to the action for which you expended it.</p>
<h5 id="item-creation-feats">Item Creation Feats</h5>
<p>An item creation feat lets a spellcaster create a magic item of a certain type. Regardless of the type of items they involve, the various item creation feats all have certain features in common.</p>
<p><strong>XP Cost:</strong> Experience that the spellcaster would normally keep is expended when making a magic item. The XP cost equals 1/25 of the cost of the item in gold pieces. A character cannot spend so much XP on an item that he or she loses a level. However, upon gaining enough XP to attain a new level, he or she can immediately expend XP on creating an item rather than keeping the XP to advance a level.</p>
<p><strong>Raw Materials Cost:</strong> The cost of creating a magic item equals one-half the sale cost of the item.</p>
<p>Using an item creation feat also requires access to a laboratory or magical workshop, special tools, and so on. A character generally has access to what he or she needs unless unusual circumstances apply.</p>
<p><strong>Time:</strong> The time to create a magic item depends on the feat and the cost of the item. The minimum time is one day.</p>
<p><strong>Item Cost:</strong> Brew Potion, Craft Wand, and Scribe Scroll create items that directly reproduce spell effects, and the power of these items depends on their caster level&ndash;that is, a spell from such an item has the power it would have if cast by a spellcaster of that level. The price of these items (and thus the XP cost and the cost of the raw materials) also depends on the caster level. The caster level must be high enough that the spellcaster creating the item can cast the spell at that level. To find the final price in each case, multiply the caster level by the spell level, then multiply the result by a constant, as shown below:</p>
<p><em>Scrolls:</em> Base price = spell level &times; caster level &times; 25 gp.</p>
<p><em>Potions:</em> Base price = spell level &times; caster level &times; 50 gp.</p>
<p><em>Wands:</em> Base price = spell level &times; caster level &times; 750 gp.</p>
<p>A 0-level spell is considered to have a spell level of &#189; for the purpose of this calculation.</p>
<p><strong>Extra Costs: </strong>Any potion, scroll, or wand that stores a spell with a costly material component or an XP cost also carries a commensurate cost. For potions and scrolls, the creator must expend the material component or pay the XP cost when creating the item.</p>
<p>For a wand, the creator must expend fifty copies of the material component or pay fifty times the XP cost.</p>
<p>Some magic items similarly incur extra costs in material components or XP, as noted in their descriptions.</p>
<h5 id="psionic-item-creation-feats">Psionic Item Creation Feats</h5>
<p>Manifesters can use their personal power to create lasting psionic items. Doing so, however, is draining. A manifester must put a little of himself or herself into every psionic item he or she creates.</p>
<p>A psionic item creation feat lets a manifester create a psionic item of a certain type. Regardless of the type of items they involve, the various item creation feats all have certain features in common.</p>
<p><strong>XP Cost:</strong> Power and energy that the manifester would normally keep is expended when making a psionic item. The experience point cost of using a psionic item creation feat equals 1/25 the cost of the item in gold pieces. A character cannot spend so much XP on an item that he or she loses a level. However, upon gaining enough XP to attain a new level, he or she can immediately expend XP on creating an item rather than keeping the XP to advance a level.</p>
<p><strong>Raw Materials Cost:</strong> Creating a psionic item requires costly components, most of which are consumed in the process. The cost of these materials equals &#189; the cost of the item.</p>
<p>Using a psionic item creation feat also requires access to a laboratory or psionic workshop, special tools, and other equipment. A character generally has access to what he or she needs unless unusual circumstances apply (such as if he's traveling far from home).</p>
<p><strong>Time:</strong> The time to create a psionic item depends on the feat and the cost of the item. The minimum time is one day.</p>
<p><strong>Item Cost:</strong> Craft Dorje, Imprint Stone, and Scribe Tattoo create items that directly reproduce the effects of powers, and the strength of these items depends on their manifester level&ndash;that is, a power from such an item has the strength it would have if manifested by a manifester of that level. Often, that is the minimum manifester level necessary to manifest the power. (Randomly discovered items usually follow this rule.) However, when making such an item, the item's strength can be set higher than the minimum. Any time a character creates an item using a power augmented by spending additional power points, the character's effective manifester level for the purpose of calculating the item's cost increases by 1 for each 1 additional power point spent. (Augmentation is a feature of many powers that allows the power to be amplified in various ways if additional power points are spent.) All other level-dependent parameters of the power forged into the item are set according to the effective manifester level.</p>
<p>The price of psionic items (and thus the XP cost and the cost of the raw materials) depends on the level of the power and a character's manifester level. The character's manifester level must be high enough that the item creator can manifest the power at the chosen level. To find the final price in each case, multiply the character's manifester level by the power level, then multiply the result by a constant, as shown below.</p>
<p><em>Power Stones:</em> Base price = power level &times; manifester level &times; 25 gp</p>
<p><em>Psionic Tattoos:</em> Base price = power level &times; manifester level &times; 50 gp</p>
<p><em>Dorjes:</em> Base price = power level &times; manifester level &times; 750 gp</p>
<p><strong>Extra Costs:</strong> Any dorje, power stone, or psionic tattoo that stores a power with an XP cost also carries a commensurate cost.</p>
<p>For psionic tattoos and power stones, the creator must pay the XP cost when creating the item. For a dorje, the creator must pay fifty times the XP cost.</p>
<p>Some psionic items similarly incur extra costs in XP, as noted in their descriptions.</p>
<h5 id="metamagic-feats">Metamagic Feats</h5>
<p>As a spellcaster's knowledge of magic grows, she can learn to cast spells in ways slightly different from the ways in which the spells were originally designed or learned. Preparing and casting a spell in such a way is harder than normal but, thanks to metamagic feats, at least it is possible.  Spells modified by a metamagic feat use a spell slot higher than normal. This does not change the level of the spell, so the DC for saving throws against it does not go up.</p>
<p><strong>Wizards and Divine Spellcasters:</strong> Wizards and divine spellcasters must prepare their spells in advance. During preparation, the character chooses which spells to prepare with metamagic feats (and thus which ones take up higher-level spell slots than normal).</p>
<p><strong>Sorcerers and Bards:</strong> Sorcerers and bards choose spells as they cast them. They can choose when they cast their spells whether to apply their metamagic feats to improve them. As with other spellcasters, the improved spell uses up a higher-level spell slot. But because the sorcerer or bard has not prepared the spell in a metamagic form in advance, he must apply the metamagic feat on the spot. Therefore, such a character must also take more time to cast a metamagic spell (one enhanced by a metamagic feat) than he does to cast a regular spell. If the spell's normal casting time is 1 action, casting a metamagic version is a full-round action for a sorcerer or bard. (This isn't the same as a 1-round casting time.)</p>
<p>For a spell with a longer casting time, it takes an extra full-round action to cast the spell.</p>
<p><strong>Spontaneous Casting and Metamagic Feats: </strong> A cleric spontaneously casting a <em>cure</em> or <em>inflict</em> spell can cast a metamagic version of it instead. Extra time is also required in this case. Casting a 1-action metamagic spell spontaneously is a full-round action, and a spell with a longer casting time takes an extra full-round action to cast.</p>
<p><strong>Effects of Metamagic Feats on a Spell:</strong> In all ways, a metamagic spell operates at its original spell level, even though it is prepared and cast as a higher-level spell. Saving throw modifications are not changed unless stated otherwise in the feat description.</p>
<p>The modifications made by these feats only apply to spells cast directly by the feat user. A spellcaster can't use a metamagic feat to alter a spell being cast from a wand, scroll, or other device.</p>
<p>Metamagic feats that eliminate components of a spell don't eliminate the attack of opportunity provoked by casting a spell while threatened. However, casting a spell modified by Quicken Spell does not provoke an attack of opportunity.</p>
<p>Metamagic feats cannot be used with all spells. See the specific feat descriptions for the spells that a particular feat can't modify.</p>
<p><strong>Multiple Metamagic Feats on a Spell:</strong> A spellcaster can apply multiple metamagic feats to a single spell. Changes to its level are cumulative. You can't apply the same metamagic feat more than once to a single spell.</p>
<p><strong>Magic Items and Metamagic Spells:</strong> With the right item creation feat, you can store a metamagic version of a spell in a scroll, potion, or wand. Level limits for potions and wands apply to the spell's higher spell level (after the application of the metamagic feat). A character doesn't need the metamagic feat to activate an item storing a metamagic version of a spell.</p>
<p><strong>Counterspelling Metamagic Spells:</strong> Whether or not a spell has been enhanced by a metamagic feat does not affect its vulnerability to counterspelling or its ability to counterspell another spell.</p>

<p>As a manifester's knowledge of psionics grows, he can learn to manifest powers in ways slightly different from how the powers were originally designed or learned. Of course, manifesting a power while using a metapsionic feat is more expensive than manifesting the power normally.</p>
<p><strong>Manifesting Time:</strong> Powers manifested using metapsionic feats take the same time as manifesting the powers normally unless the feat description specifically says otherwise.</p>
<p><strong>Manifestation Cost:</strong> To use a metapsionic feat, a psionic character must both expend his psionic focus (see the Concentration skill description) and pay an increased power point cost as given in the feat description.</p>
<p><strong>Limits on Use:</strong> As with all powers, you cannot spend more power points on a power than your manifester level. Metapsionic feats merely let you manifest powers in different ways; they do not let you violate this rule.</p>
<p><strong>Effects of Metapsionic Feats on a Power:</strong> In all ways, a metapsionic power operates at its original power level, even though it costs additional power points. The modifications to a power made by a metapsionic feat have only their noted effect on the power. A manifester can't use a metapsionic feat to alter a power being cast from a power stone, dorje, or other device.</p>
<p>Manifesting a power modified by the Quicken Power feat does not provoke attacks of opportunity.</p>
<p>Some metapsionic feats apply only to certain powers, as described in each specific feat entry.</p>
<p><strong>Psionic Items and Metapsionic Powers:</strong> With the right psionic item creation feat, you can store a metapsionic power in a power stone, psionic tattoo, or dorje. Level limits for psionic tattoos apply to the power's higher metapsionic level.</p>
<p>A character doesn't need the appropriate metapsionic feat to activate an item in which a metapsionic power is stored, but does need the metapsionic feat to create such an item.</p>
