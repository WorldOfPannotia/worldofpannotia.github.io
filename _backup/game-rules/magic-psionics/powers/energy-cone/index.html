        <p>Sonic: A cone of this energy type deals -1 point of damage per die and ignores an object's hardness.</p>

        <p><strong>Augment:</strong> For every additional power point you spend, this power's damage increases by one die (d6). For each extra two dice of damage, this power's save DC increases by 1.</p>
