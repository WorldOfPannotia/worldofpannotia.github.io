        <p>As ectoplasmic cocoon, except you can cocoon several creatures (or a single big creature that fits in a 20-foot radius sphere or hemisphere) in a mass of writhing ectoplasm. Targets entirely within the area who fail their save are caught and cocooned. If a creature's body is only partially within the area, this power does not affect that creature.</p>
        <p><strong>Augment:</strong> For every 2 additional power points you spend, the radius of this power's area increases by 5 feet.</p>
