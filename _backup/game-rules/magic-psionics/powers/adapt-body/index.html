        <p><strong>Level:</strong> Psion/Wilder 5, Psychic Warrior 5</p>
        <p><strong>Display:</strong> Visual</p>
        <p><strong>Manifesting Time:</strong> 1 standard action</p>
        <p><strong>Range:</strong> Personal</p>
        <p><strong>Target:</strong> You</p>
        <p><strong>Duration:</strong> 1 hour/level (D)</p>
        <p><strong>Power Points:</strong> 9</p>
        <p>Your body automatically adapts to hostile environments. You can adapt to underwater, extremely hot, extremely cold, or airless environments, allowing you to survive as if you were a creature native to that environment. You can breathe and move (though penalties to movement and attacks, if any for a particular environment, remain), and you take no damage simply from being in that environment. You need not specify what environment you are adapting to when you manifest this power; simply activate it, and your body will instantly adapt to any hostile environment as needed throughout the duration.</p>
        <p>You can somewhat adapt to extreme environmental features such as acid, lava, fire, and electricity. Any environmental feature that normally directly deals 1 or more dice of damage per round deals you only half the usual amount of damage.</p>
