        <p>You (plus all your gear and any objects you carry) become difficult to detect by clairsentience powers such as clairvoyant sense, remote viewing, and psionic true seeing. If a clairsentience power or similar effect is attempted against you, the manifester of the power must succeed on a manifester level check (1d20 + manifester level, or caster level if the opponent is not a manifester) against a DC of 13 + your manifester level (maximum +10).</p>
