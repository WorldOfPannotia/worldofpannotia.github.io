        <p><em>Telepathy (Compulsion) [Mind-Affecting]</em></p>
        <p><strong>Level:</strong> Psion/Wilder 6</p>
        <p><strong>Display:</strong> Mental</p>
        <p><strong>Manifesting Time:</strong> 1 standard action</p>
        <p><strong>Range:</strong> Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./ level)</p>
        <p><strong>Target:</strong> One creature</p>
        <p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 round/level</p>
        <p><strong>Saving Throw:</strong> Will negates</p>
        <p><strong>Power Resistance:</strong> Yes</p>
        <p><strong>Power Points:</strong> 11</p>
        <p>You take over control of a power that was manifested by the subject and that must be maintained through concentration. Once you wrest control of the power from the subject, you have several options.</p>
<ul>
<li>Allow the power to function as normal.</li>
<li>Keep the power targeted on the subject (if a personal power) but decide how the power fulfills its function each round.</li>
<li>Retarget the power on yourself (if a personal power).</li>
<li>Choose not to concentrate on the co-opted power in the next round, ending the power at that point.</li>
</ul>
<p>When the duration of co-opt concentration expires, the power you took control of ends (even if this would mean that the power ends earlier than normal).</p>
