        <p><em>Telepathy (Compulsion) [Mind-Affecting]</em></p>
        <p><strong>Level:</strong> Psion/Wilder 1</p>
        <p><strong>Display:</strong> Visual</p>
        <p><strong>Manifesting Time:</strong> 1 standard action</p>
        <p><strong>Range:</strong> 20 ft.</p>
        <p><strong>Area:</strong> Cone-shaped emanation centered on you</p>
        <p><strong>Duration:</strong> 1 min./level (D)</p>
        <p><strong>Saving Throw:</strong> Will negates</p>
        <p><strong>Power Resistance:</strong> Yes</p>
        <p><strong>Power Points:</strong> 1</p>
        <p>You broadcast a mental compulsion that convinces one or more creatures of 4 Hit Dice or less that they are disabled. Creatures with the fewest HD are affected first. Among creatures with equal Hit Dice, those who are closest to the power's point of origin are affected first. Hit Dice that are not sufficient to affect a creature are wasted. Creatures that are rendered helpless or are destroyed when they reach 0 hit points cannot be affected.</p>
        <p>Creatures affected by this power believe that they have somehow been brought to the brink of unconsciousness and must act accordingly. While it's possible for an important nonplayer character to attempt some sort of "heroic" action, common NPCs and creatures under the effect of this power typically cower or retreat.</p>
        <p>Any creature that attempts to take a standard action immediately breaks the compulsion and can act normally. A creature that attempts to heal itself or that receives healing is likewise freed of the compulsion, and if it is not actually wounded, the healing is wasted. A creature that takes damage is also instantly freed of the compulsion (although the damage still counts against its actual current hit points).</p>
        <p><strong>Augment:</strong> For every 2 additional power points you spend, this power's range increases by 5 feet and its save DC increases by 1.</p>
        <p>In addition, for every additional power point you spend to increase the range and the save DC, this power can affect targets that have Hit Dice equal to 4 + the number of additional points.</p>
