        <p><strong>Level:</strong> Psion/Wilder 4</p>
        <p><strong>Display:</strong> Visual</p>
        <p><strong>Manifesting Time:</strong> 1 standard action</p>
        <p><strong>Range:</strong> 60 ft.</p>
        <p><strong>Area:</strong> Cone-shaped emanation centered on you</p>
        <p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 10 min./level</p>

        <p><strong>Power Points:</strong> 7</p>
        <p>You discern auras. Auras are invisible to the naked eye, but to a psionic viewer manifesting this power they appear as glowing halos or envelopes of colored light that surround all objects. The color of each aura reveals information to the psionic character. The amount of information revealed depends on how long you study a particular area.</p>
        <p>1st Round: Presence of good and evil auras in the area. You can't pin an aura to a particular object or individual at this stage; instead, you see a colored haze suffusing the area. (This power can detect lawful and chaotic auras as well, but doing so requires a separate manifestation that focuses only on that alignment axis.)</p>
        <p>2nd Round: Number of auras (creatures, objects, powers, or spells) in the area. You know how many auras are in the area, even though each aura doesn't resolve to its actual location quite yet.</p>
        <p>3rd Round: The owner of each aura is revealed, unless the individual is outside your line of sight. If a creature whose aura you detect has 5 or more Hit Dice than you do, you are overwhelmed by its presence and dazed for 1 round, and the power ends.</p>
        <p><strong>Augment:</strong> For every 2 additional power points you spend, this power's range increases by 5 feet.</p>
