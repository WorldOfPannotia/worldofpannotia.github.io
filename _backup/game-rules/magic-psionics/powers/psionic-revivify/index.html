        <p>Psionic revivify lets a manifester reconnect a corpse's psyche with its body, restoring life to a recently deceased creature. The power must be manifested within 1 round of the victim's death. Before the psyche of the deceased has completely left the body, this power halts its journey while repairing somewhat the damage to the body.</p>
        <p>This power functions like the raise dead spell, except that the affected creature receives no level loss, no Constitution loss, and no loss of powers.</p>
        <p>The creature has -1 hit points (but is stable) after being restored to life.</p>
        <p><strong>XP Cost:</strong> 200 XP.</p>
        <p><strong>Augment:</strong> For every 100 additional experience points that both you and the subject pay, the manifestation of this power can be delayed by 1 additional round.</p>
