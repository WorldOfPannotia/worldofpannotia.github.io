        <p><strong>Level:</strong> Psion/Wilder 6, Psychic Warrior 6</p>
        <p><strong>Display:</strong> Olfactory</p>
        <p><strong>Manifesting Time:</strong> 1 standard action</p>
        <p><strong>Range:</strong> Personal</p>
        <p><strong>Target:</strong> You</p>
        <p><strong>Duration:</strong> Permanent unless ended or dismissed; see text</p>
        <p><strong>Power Points:</strong> 11</p>
        <p>You can place yourself into a trance so deep that you are almost in suspended animation. Even powers that detect life or thought are incapable of determining that you are alive.</p>
        <p>While you are suspended, you are aware of your surroundings. You feel the passage of one day for every year that actually passes. Though on a slower schedule, you grow hungry after a "day" without food (though a year passes in actuality) and begin to suffer the effects of thirst and starvation as appropriate.</p>
        <p>If you take any damage, you come out of your trance 4 rounds later. The trance can also be ended by a successful use of dispel psionics. If you choose to dismiss the power, your trance ends 10 rounds later.</p>
