        <p><strong>Manifesting Time:</strong> 1 round</p>
        <p><strong>Range:</strong> Long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)</p>
        <p><strong>Target:</strong> One creature</p>
        <p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 min./level (D)</p>

        <p>You have a limited ability to falsify one of the subject's senses. The subject thinks she sees, hears, smells, tastes, or feels something other than what her senses actually report. You can't create a sensation where none exists, nor make the subject completely oblivious to a sensation, but you can replace the specifics of one sensation with different specifics. For instance, you could make a human look like a dwarf (or one human look like another specific human), a closed door look like it is open, a vat of acid smell like rose water, a parrot look like a bookend, stale rations taste like fresh fruit, a light pat feel like a dagger thrust, a scream sound like the howling wind, and so on.</p>
        <p>You can switch between senses you falsify round by round. You can't alter the size of an object by more than 50% by using this power. Thus, you couldn't make a castle look like a hovel, but you could make it look like a different castle, or a rough hillock of approximately the same size. If this power is used to distract an enemy manifester who is attempting to use his powers, the enemy must make a Concentration check as if grappling or pinned.</p>
        <p>Because you override a victim's senses, you can fool a victim who is using true seeing or some other method of gathering information, assuming you know that the victim is actively using such an effect and you can maintain concentration.</p>
        <p><strong>Augment:</strong> For every 2 additional power points you spend, this power can affect an additional target. Any additional target cannot be more than 15 feet from another target of the power.</p>
