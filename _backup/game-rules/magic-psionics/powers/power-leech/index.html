        <p><em>Telepathy (Compulsion) [Mind-Affecting]</em></p>
        <p><strong>Level:</strong> Psion/Wilder 4</p>
        <p><strong>Display:</strong> Visual; see text</p>
        <p><strong>Manifesting Time:</strong> 1 standard action</p>
        <p><strong>Range:</strong> Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)</p>
        <p><strong>Target:</strong> Any psionic creature</p>
        <p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 round/level; see text</p>
        <p><strong>Saving Throw:</strong> Will negates</p>
        <p><strong>Power Resistance:</strong> Yes</p>
        <p><strong>Power Points:</strong> 7</p>
        <p>Your brow erupts with an arc of crackling dark energy that connects with your foe, draining it of 1d6 power points and adding 1 of those points to your reserve (unless that gain would cause you to exceed your maximum).</p>
        <p>The drain continues in each round you maintain concentration while the subject of the drain remains in range. If the subject is drained to 0 power points, this power ends.</p>
        <p>Concentrating to maintain power leech is a full-round action (you can take no other actions aside from a 5-foot step) instead of a standard action.</p>
