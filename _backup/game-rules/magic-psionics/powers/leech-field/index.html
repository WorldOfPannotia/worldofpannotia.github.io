        <p><strong>Level:</strong> Psion/Wilder 5</p>
        <p><strong>Display:</strong> Visual; see text</p>
        <p><strong>Manifesting Time:</strong> 1 standard action</p>
        <p><strong>Range:</strong> Personal; see text</p>
        <p><strong>Target:</strong> You</p>
        <p><strong>Duration:</strong> 1 min.</p>
        <p><strong>Power Points:</strong> 9</p>
        <p>You raise a field of potentiality that drains the vitality from powers that you successfully save against. When you succeed on a saving throw to negate the effect of a foe's power on you, and the power is one that leech field is effective against (see below), your body erupts in a brief flash of crackling dark energy. You gain 1 power point for every 2 power points your foe spent to manifest the power you just saved against (to a maximum number of points equal to your manifester level). You cannot gain power points that would cause you to exceed your normal daily maximum.</p>
        <p>This power is effective against any power that targets a single creature and allows the target a saving throw to negate it, except those that are delivered by a touch attack or a ranged touch attack (including a ray).</p>
        <p><strong>Augment:</strong> For every 2 additional power points you spend, this power's duration increases by 1 minute.</p>
