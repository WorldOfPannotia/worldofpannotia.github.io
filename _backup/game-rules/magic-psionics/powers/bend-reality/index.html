        <p>Bend reality lets you create nearly any type of effect. For example, bend reality can do any of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Duplicate any psion power of 6th level or lower, provided the power is not of a discipline prohibited to you.</li>
<li>Duplicate any other power (but not a spell) of 5th level or lower, provided the power is not of a discipline prohibited to you.</li>
<li>Duplicate any psion power of 5th level or lower, even if it's of a prohibited discipline.</li>
<li>Duplicate any other power (but not a spell) of 4th level or lower, even if it's of a prohibited discipline.</li>
<li>Undo the harmful effects of many powers, such as psionic dominate, geas/quest, or insanity.</li>
<li>Produce any other effect whose power level is in line with the above effects, such as a single creature automatically hitting on its next attack or taking a -8 penalty on its next saving throw.</li>
</ul>
<p>A duplicated power allows saving throws and power resistance as normal (but the save DC is for a 8th-level power).</p>
        <p>When bend reality duplicates a power that has an XP cost, you must pay that cost or 300 XP, whichever is more. When bend reality duplicates a spell with a material component, you must pay additional XP equal to the value of the material component divided by 5.</p>
        <p><strong>XP Cost:</strong> 300 XP or more (see above).</p>
