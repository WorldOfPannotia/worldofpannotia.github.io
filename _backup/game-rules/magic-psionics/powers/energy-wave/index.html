This power originates at your hand and extends outward in a cone.</p>

        <p>Electricity: Manifesting a wave of this energy type provides a +2 bonus to the save DC and a +2 bonus on manifester level checks for the purpose of overcoming power resistance.</p>
        <p>Fire: A wave of this energy type deals +1 point of damage per die.</p>
        <p>Sonic: A wave of this energy type deals -1 point of damage per die and ignores an object's hardness.</p>

        <p><strong>Augment:</strong> For every additional power point you spend, this power's damage increases by one die (d6). For each extra two dice of damage, this power's save DC increases by 1.</p>
