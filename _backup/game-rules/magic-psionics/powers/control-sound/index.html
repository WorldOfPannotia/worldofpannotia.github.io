        <p><em>Psychokinesis [Sonic]</em></p>
        <p><strong>Level:</strong> Psion/Wilder 2</p>
        <p><strong>Display:</strong> Auditory; see text</p>
        <p><strong>Manifesting Time:</strong> 1 standard action</p>
        <p><strong>Range:</strong> Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./ level)</p>
        <p><strong>Target:</strong> One sound or mixture of related sounds</p>
        <p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 min./level; see text</p>
        <p><strong>Saving Throw:</strong> None</p>
        <p><strong>Power Resistance:</strong> No</p>
        <p><strong>Power Points:</strong> 3</p>
        <p>You shape and alter existing sounds. You can target one sound, such as a person speaking or singing, or a group of related sounds, such as the patter of many raindrops or the tramp of soldiers passing by. A sound as quiet as a snapping finger can be controlled. You can substitute any sound you have heard for the target sound. If you attempt to exactly duplicate the voice of a specific individual, or an inherently terrifying sound (such as a dragon's roar), you must succeed on a Bluff check with a +5 circumstance bonus opposed by the intended listener's Sense Motive check to avoid arousing suspicion.</p>
        <p>You can entirely muffle a noise or magnify a sound to such loudness that it drowns out all other conversation in the immediate area. In this way, you can provide yourself or any with a +4 circumstance bonus on Move Silently and Listen checks.</p>
        <p>Alternatively, you can use up the power in an instant. You do this by modulating a sound into a one-time destructive impetus that shatters nonmagical/nonpsionic, unattended objects of crystal, glass, ceramics, or porcelain (vials, bottles, flasks, jugs, mirrors, and so forth) in the area.</p>
