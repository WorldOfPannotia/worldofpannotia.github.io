        <p>As the confusion spell, except as noted here.</p>
        <p>Swift tendrils of thought disrupt the unconscious mind of any one creature, sapping its might. As long as the manifester remains concentrating fully on this power, the subject is confused, making it unable to independently determine it will do. Roll on the following table at the beginning of each of the subject's turns to see what the subject does in that round.</p>
<table class="table table-bordered table-hover">
<tr><th>d%</th><th>Behavior</th></tr>
<tr><td>01-10</td><td>Attack manifester with melee or ranged weapons (or move toward manifester if attack is not possible).</td></tr>
<tr><td>11-20</td><td>Act normally.</td></tr>
<tr><td>21-50</td><td>Do nothing but babble incoherently.</td></tr>
<tr><td>51-70</td><td>Flee from manifester at top possible speed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>71-100</td><td>Attack nearest creature (for this purpose, a psicrystal counts as part of the subject's self).</td></tr>
