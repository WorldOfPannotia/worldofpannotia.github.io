        <p><em>Telepathy [Mind-Affecting]</em></p>
        <p><strong>Level:</strong> Psion/Wilder 5, Psychic Warrior 5</p>
        <p><strong>Display:</strong> Mental and visual</p>
        <p><strong>Manifesting Time:</strong> 1 standard action</p>
        <p><strong>Range:</strong> 30 ft.</p>
        <p><strong>Area:</strong> 30-ft.-radius emanation centered on you</p>
        <p><strong>Duration:</strong> 1 round/level</p>
        <p><strong>Saving Throw:</strong> Will negates; see text</p>
        <p><strong>Power Resistance:</strong> Yes</p>
        <p><strong>Power Points:</strong> 9</p>
        <p>By manifesting this power, you generate psychic static, interfering with the ability of other psionic characters to manifest their powers or use psi-like abilities (you are not affected by your own catapsi manifestation). All psionic activity within the area requires 4 more power points to manifest than normal, unless a character makes a Will save each time he attempts to manifest a power. Using a psi-like ability becomes a full-round action, instead of a standard action, in a catapsi field. If two or more fields of catapsi overlap, the effects are not cumulative.</p>
        <p>The limit on the number of power points a subject can spend on a power remains in effect; thus, a subject may not be able to manifest its highest-level powers. If manifesting a power would cause the manifester to exceed his available power points or his spending limits, the manifestation fails automatically, but no power points are expended.</p>
        <p><strong>Augment:</strong> For every 4 additional power points you spend, this power's range and the radius of its area both increase by 5 feet.</p>
