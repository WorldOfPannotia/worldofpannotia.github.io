        <p><strong>Level:</strong> Psion/Wilder 3</p>
        <p><strong>Display:</strong> Auditory and visual</p>
        <p><strong>Manifesting Time:</strong> 1 standard action</p>
        <p><strong>Range:</strong> Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)</p>
        <p><strong>Target:</strong> One Medium or smaller creature, or one object weighing 300 lb. or less</p>
        <p><strong>Duration:</strong> 1 round/level; see text</p>
        <p><strong>Saving Throw:</strong> Will negates</p>
        <p><strong>Power Resistance:</strong> Yes</p>
        <p><strong>Power Points:</strong> 5</p>
        <p>The subject of the power hops forward in time 1 round for every manifester level you have. In effect, the subject seems to disappear in a shimmer of silver energy, then reappear after the duration of this power expires. The subject reappears in exactly the same orientation and condition as before. From the subject's point of view, no time has passed at all.</p>
        <p>In each round of the power's duration, on what would have been the subject's turn, it can attempt a DC 15 Wisdom check. Success allows the subject to return. The subject can act normally on its next turn after this power ends.</p>
        <p>If the space from which the subject departed is occupied upon his return to the time stream, he appears in the closest unoccupied space, still in his original orientation. Determine the closest space randomly if necessary.</p>
        <p><strong>Augment:</strong> You can augment this power in one or both of the following ways.</p>
<ol>
<li>For every 2 additional power points you spend, you can affect a creature of one size category larger, or double the weight of an object to be affected.</li>
<li>For every 2 additional power points you spend, this power can affect an additional target. Any additional target cannot be more than 15 feet from another target of the power.</li>
</ol>
