        <p>You can adjust your body's equilibrium to correspond with any solid or liquid that you stand on. Thus, you can walk on water, quicksand, or even a spider's web without sinking or breaking through (this effect does not confer any resistance to particularly sticky webs). You can move at your normal speed, but you cannot run (x4 speed) on an unfirm surface without sinking or breaking through.</p>
        <p>If you fall from any height while using this power, damage from the impact is halved.</p>
