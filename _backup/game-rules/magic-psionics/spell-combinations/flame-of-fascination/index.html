        <p><em>Illusion & Evocation [Pattern, Fire, Mind-Affecting]</em></p>
        <p><strong>Component Spells:</strong> <a href="#">rainbow pattern</a>; <a href="#">wall of fire</a></p>
        <p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 standard action (two casters)</p>
        <p><strong>Range:</strong> Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level) (use lowest caster level)</p>
        <p><strong>Target:</strong> fascinating flame with a 20-ft.-radius spread</p>
        <p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration +1 round/level (use the lower of the two caster levels)</p>
        <p><strong>Saving Throw:</strong> Will negates, Reflex half if Will save is successful (higher save DCs)</p>
        <p><strong>Spell Resistance:</strong> Yes</p>
        <p>Brilliant and colorful flames dance and <a href="#">fascinate</a> those within the area of effect. The flame of fascination will <a href="#">fascinate</a> a maximum of 24 Hit Dice of creatures. Creatures with the fewest HD are affected first. Among creatures with equal HD, those who are closest to the spell's point of origin are affected first. An affected creature that fails its saves is <a href="#">fascinated</a> by the pattern.</p>
        <p>Creatures that fail their Will save take 2d4 damage per round. The wall deals double damage to undead creatures. If the creature passes its initial save, it must also make a Reflex save or take &#189; damage.</p>
        <p>With concentrated effort (a move action), both casters can make the Flame of Fascination move up to 30 feet per round (moving its effective point of origin). All fascinated creatures follow the moving flames, trying to get or remain within the effect. Fascinated creatures who are restrained and removed from the fascinating flames still try to follow it. If the pattern leads its subjects into a dangerous area each fascinated creature gets a second Will save, but still takes damage from fire as normal. If the view of the flame is completely blocked, creatures who can't see them are no longer affected.</p>
        <p><strong>Special:</strong> Damage from this spell does not break the fascination effect, although damage or effects from other sources will.</p>
