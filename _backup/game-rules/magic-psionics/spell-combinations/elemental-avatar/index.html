        <p>The target creature transforms into a Large elemental of the appropriate type, depending on the component spells: air for wind wall, earth for stone shape, fire for fireball, and water for control water.</p>
        <p>Once transformed, the target gains all of the elemental's extraordinary, supernatural, and spell-like abilities. She also gains the elemental's feats for as long as she is in elemental form, but she retains her own creature type. In addition, she changes her ability scores according to the following table for as long as she is in elemental form:</p>
