        <p><strong>Component Spells:</strong> <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/stoneskin.htm">stoneskin</a></p>
        <p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 standard action (two casters)</p>
        <p><strong>Range:</strong> Touch</p>
        <p><strong>Target:</strong> Creature touched</p>
        <p><strong>Duration:</strong> 1 min./level (use the lower of the two caster levels)</p>
        <p><strong>Saving Throw:</strong> Will negates (harmless; higher save DC)</p>
        <p><strong>Spell Resistance:</strong> Yes (harmless)</p>
        <p>The warded creature's skin turns to a shimmering metal, and it gains resistance to blows, cuts, stabs, and slashes as per the normal stoneskin spell. However, this resistance is much higher than normal. The subject gains damage reduction 25/adamantine and magic. (It ignores the first 25 points of damage each time it takes damage from a weapon, though a magic adamantine weapon bypasses the reduction.) Once the spell has prevented a total of 25 points of damage per caster level (maximum 500 points), it is discharged.</p>
        <p><strong>Special:</strong> Because the target's skin turns to metal, they are vulnerable to the <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/heatMetal.htm">heat metal</a> spell. Use the following table as a substitute for the one in the spell description:</p>
<table class="table table-bordered table-hover">
	<tr><th class="title" colspan="3">Table: Heat Metal Damage</th></tr>
	<tr><th>Round</th><th>Metal Temperature</th><th>Damage</th></tr>
	<tr><td>1</td><td>Warm</td><td>None</td></tr>
	<tr><td>2</td><td>Hot</td><td>2d4 points</td></tr>
	<tr><td>3-5</td><td>Searing</td><td>3d6 points</td></tr>
	<tr><td>6</td><td>Hot</td><td>2d4 points</td></tr>
	<tr><td>7</td><td>Warm</td><td>None</td></tr>

<p><em>Material Component:</em> A piece of adamantine and 500gp worth of diamond dust sprinkled on the target's skin.</p>
