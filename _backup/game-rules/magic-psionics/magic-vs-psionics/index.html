<p>
    For the purpose of mechanics, magic and psionics in Pannotia are considered
    different. Spell Resistance is ineffective against psionics, and Power
    Resistance is ineffective against spells. However, many creatures with
    resistance to one have resistance to the other. See
    <a href="{{ site.url }}/game-rules/magic-psionics/monsters-and-power-resistance/">Monsters &amp; Power Resistance</a>
    for more details.
