        <p><strong>Saving Throw:</strong> Will negates</p>
        <p>This spell functions like symbol of death, except that all creatures within 60 feet of a symbol of stunning instead become stunned for 1d6 rounds.</p>
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> Magic traps such as symbol of stunning are hard to detect and disable. A rogue (only) can use the Search skill to find a symbol of stunning and Disable Device to thwart it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 32 for symbol of stunning.</p>
        <p><em>Material Component:</em> Mercury and phosphorus, plus powdered diamond and opal with a total value of at least 5,000 gp.</p>
