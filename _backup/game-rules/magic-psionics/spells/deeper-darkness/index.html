        <p><em>Evocation [Darkness]</em></p>
        <p><strong>Level:</strong> Clr 3</p>
        <p><strong>Duration:</strong> One day/level (D)</p>
        <p>This spell functions like darkness, except that the object radiates shadowy illumination in a 60-foot radius and the darkness lasts longer.</p>
        <p>Daylight brought into an area of deeper darkness (or vice versa) is temporarily negated, so that the otherwise prevailing light conditions exist in the overlapping areas of effect.</p>
        <p>Deeper darkness counters and dispels any light spell of equal or lower level, including daylight and light.</p>
