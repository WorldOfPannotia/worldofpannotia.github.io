        <p>As status, but you can also cast a limited selection of spells through the link, as if you were touching the target. You can cast any spell that meets the following conditions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Level: 0, 1st, or 2nd</li>
            <li>Range: Touch</li>
            <li>Target: Creature touched</li>
            <li>Saving Throw: harmless</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For example, if you become aware (through the greater status spell) that one of your linked companions is dying, you can cast cure moderate wounds to try to revive her.</p>
