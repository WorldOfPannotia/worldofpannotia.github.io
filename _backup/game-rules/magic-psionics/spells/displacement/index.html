        <p>The subject of this spell appears to be about 2 feet away from its true location. The creature benefits from a 50% miss chance as if it had total concealment. However, unlike actual total concealment, displacement does not prevent enemies from targeting the creature normally. True seeing reveals its true location.</p>
        <p><em>Material Component:</em> A small strip of leather twisted into a loop.</p>
