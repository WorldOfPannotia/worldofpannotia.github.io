        <p><strong>Level:</strong> n/a</p>
        <p><strong>Cleric Domains:</strong> Evil 4</p>
        <p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S</p>
        <p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 standard action</p>
        <p><strong>Range:</strong> Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)</p>
        <p><strong>Area:</strong> 20-ft.-radius spread</p>
        <p><strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous (1d4 rounds); see text</p>

        <p>You call up unholy power to smite your enemies. The power takes the form of a cold, cloying miasma of greasy darkness.</p>
        <p>Only good and neutral (not evil) creatures are harmed by the spell.</p>
        <p>The spell deals 1d8 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d8) to a good creature (or 1d6 per caster level, maximum 10d6, to a good outsider) and causes it to be sickened for 1d4 rounds. A successful Will save reduces damage to half and negates the sickened effect. The effects cannot be negated by remove disease or heal, but remove curse is effective.</p>
        <p>The spell deals only half damage to creatures who are neither evil nor good, and they are not sickened. Such a creature can reduce the damage in half again (down to one-quarter) with a successful Will save.</p>
