        <p><em>Enchantment [Mind-Affecting]</em></p>
        <p><strong>Level:</strong> n/a</p>
        <p><strong>Cleric Domains:</strong> Madness 2</p>
        <p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S</p>
        <p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 standard action</p>
        <p><strong>Range:</strong> Touch</p>
        <p><strong>Target:</strong> Creature touched</p>
        <p><strong>Duration:</strong> 1 round/level</p>
        <p><strong>Saving Throw:</strong> Will negates</p>
        <p><strong>Spell Resistance:</strong> Yes</p>
        <p>The caster may daze one living creature by making a successful touch attack. If the target creature does not make a successful Will save, its mind is clouded and it takes no action for 1 round per caster level. The dazed subject is not stunned (so attackers get no special advantage against it), but it can't move, cast spells, use mental abilities, and so on.</p>
