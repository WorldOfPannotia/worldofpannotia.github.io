        <p><em>Conjuration (Teleportation)</em></p>
        <p><strong>Level:</strong> Sor/Wiz 7</p>
        <p><strong>Range:</strong> Touch</p>
        <p><strong>Target:</strong> One touched object of up to 50 lb./level and 3 cu. ft./level</p>
        <p><strong>Saving Throw:</strong> Will negates (object)</p>
        <p><strong>Spell Resistance:</strong> Yes (object)</p>
        <p>This spell functions like teleport, except that it teleports an object, not you. Creatures and magical forces cannot be teleported.</p>
        <p>If desired, the target object can be sent to a distant location on the Ethereal Plane. In this case, the point from which the object was teleported remains faintly magical until the item is retrieved. A successful targeted dispel magic spell cast on that point brings the vanished item back from the Ethereal Plane.</p>
