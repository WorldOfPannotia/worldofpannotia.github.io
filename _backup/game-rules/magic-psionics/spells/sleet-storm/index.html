        <p>Driving sleet blocks all sight (even darkvision) within it and causes the ground in the area to be icy. A creature can walk within or through the area of sleet at half normal speed with a DC 10 Balance check. Failure means it can't move in that round, while failure by 5 or more means it falls (see the Balance skill for details).</p>
        <p>The sleet extinguishes torches and small fires.</p>
        <p><em>Arcane Material Component:</em> A pinch of dust and a few drops of water.</p>
