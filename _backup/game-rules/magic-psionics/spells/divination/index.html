        <p>Similar to augury but more powerful, a divination spell can provide you with a useful piece of advice in reply to a question concerning a specific goal, event, or activity that is to occur within one week. The advice can be as simple as a short phrase, or it might take the form of a cryptic rhyme or omen. If your party doesn't act on the information, the conditions may change so that the information is no longer useful. The base chance for a correct divination is 70% + 1% per caster level, to a maximum of 90%. If the dice roll fails, you know the spell failed, unless specific magic yielding false information is at work.</p>
        <p>As with augury, multiple divinations about the same topic by the same caster use the same dice result as the first divination spell and yield the same answer each time.</p>
        <p><em>Material Component:</em> Incense and a sacrificial offering appropriate to your religion, together worth at least 25 gp.</p>
