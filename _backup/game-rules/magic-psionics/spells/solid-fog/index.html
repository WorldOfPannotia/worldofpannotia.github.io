        <p><em>Conjuration (Creation)</em></p>
        <p><strong>Level:</strong> Sor/Wiz 4</p>
        <p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M</p>
        <p><strong>Duration:</strong> 1 min./level</p>
        <p><strong>Spell Resistance:</strong> No</p>
        <p>This spell functions like fog cloud, but in addition to obscuring sight, the solid fog is so thick that any creature attempting to move through it progresses at a speed of 5 feet, regardless of its normal speed, and it takes a -2 penalty on all melee attack and melee damage rolls. The vapors prevent effective ranged weapon attacks (except for magic rays and the like). A creature or object that falls into solid fog is slowed, so that each 10 feet of vapor that it passes through reduces falling damage by 1d6. A creature can't take a 5-foot step while in solid fog.</p>
        <p>However, unlike normal fog, only a severe wind (31+ mph) disperses these vapors, and it does so in 1 round.</p>
        <p>Solid fog can be made permanent with a permanency spell. A permanent solid fog dispersed by wind reforms in 10 minutes.</p>
        <p><em>Material Component:</em> A pinch of dried, powdered peas combined with powdered animal hoof.</p>
