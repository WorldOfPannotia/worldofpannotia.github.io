        <p><em>Necromancy</em></p>
        <p><strong>Level:</strong> Sor/Wiz 2</p>
        <p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M</p>
        <p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 standard action</p>
        <p><strong>Range:</strong> Touch</p>
        <p><strong>Target:</strong> Living humanoid touched</p>
        <p><strong>Duration:</strong> 1d6+2 rounds</p>
        <p><strong>Saving Throw:</strong> Fortitude negates</p>
        <p><strong>Spell Resistance:</strong> Yes</p>
        <p>Imbuing you with negative energy, this spell allows you to paralyze a single living humanoid for the duration of the spell with a successful melee touch attack.</p>
        <p>Additionally, the paralyzed subject exudes a carrion stench that causes all living creatures (except you) in a 10-foot-radius spread to become sickened (Fortitude negates). A neutralize poison spell removes the effect from a sickened creature, and creatures immune to poison are unaffected by the stench.</p>
        <p><em>Material Component:</em> A small scrap of cloth taken from clothing worn by a ghoul, or a pinch of earth from a ghoul's lair.</p>
