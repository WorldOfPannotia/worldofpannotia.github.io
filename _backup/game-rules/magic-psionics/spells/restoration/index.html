        <p><em>Conjuration (Healing)</em></p>
        <p><strong>Level:</strong> Clr 4, Pal 4</p>
        <p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M</p>
        <p>This spell functions like lesser restoration, except that it also dispels negative levels and restores one experience level to a creature who has had a level drained. The drained level is restored only if the time since the creature lost the level is equal to or less than one day per caster level. A character who has a level restored by restoration has exactly the minimum number of experience points necessary to restore him or her to his or her previous level.</p>
        <p>Restoration cures all temporary ability damage, and it restores all points permanently drained from a single ability score (your choice if more than one is drained). It also eliminates any fatigue or exhaustion suffered by the target.</p>
        <p>Restoration does not restore levels or Constitution points lost due to death.</p>
        <p><em>Material Component:</em> Diamond dust worth 100 gp that is sprinkled over the target.</p>
