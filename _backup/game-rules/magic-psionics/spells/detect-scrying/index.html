        <p><em>Divination</em></p>
        <p><strong>Level:</strong> Brd 4, Sor/Wiz 4</p>
        <p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M</p>
        <p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 standard action</p>
        <p><strong>Range:</strong> 40 ft.</p>
        <p><strong>Area:</strong> 40-ft.-radius emanation centered on you</p>
        <p><strong>Duration:</strong> 24 hours</p>
        <p><strong>Saving Throw:</strong> None</p>
        <p><strong>Spell Resistance:</strong> No</p>
        <p>You immediately become aware of any attempt to observe you by means of a divination (scrying) spell or effect. The spell's area radiates from you and moves as you move. You know the location of every magical sensor within the spell's area.</p>
        <p>If the scrying attempt originates within the area, you also know its location; otherwise, you and the scrier immediately make opposed caster level checks (1d20 + caster level). If you at least match the scrier's result, you get a visual image of the scrier and an accurate sense of his or her direction and distance from you.</p>
        <p><em>Material Component:</em> A small piece of mirror and a miniature brass hearing trumpet.</p>
