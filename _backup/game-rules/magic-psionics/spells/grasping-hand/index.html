        <p><em>Evocation [Force]</em></p>
        <p><strong>Level:</strong> Sor/Wiz 7</p>
        <p><strong>Cleric Domains:</strong> Strength 7</p>
        <p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, F/DF</p>
        <p>This spell functions like interposing hand, except the hand can also grapple one opponent that you select. The grasping hand gets one grapple attack per round.</p>
        <p>Its attack bonus to make contact equals your caster level + your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier (for wizards, clerics, and sorcerers, respectively), +10 for the hand's Strength score (31), -1 for being Large. Its grapple bonus is this same figure, except with a +4 modifier for being Large instead of -1. The hand holds but does not harm creatures it grapples.</p>
        <p>Directing the spell to a new target is a move action.</p>
        <p>The grasping hand can also bull rush an opponent as forceful hand does, but at a +16 bonus on the Strength check (+10 for Strength 31, +4 for being Large, and a +2 bonus for charging, which it always gets), or interpose itself as interposing hand does.</p>
        <p>Clerics who cast this spell name it for their deities.</p>
        <p><em>Arcane Focus:</em> A leather glove.</p>
