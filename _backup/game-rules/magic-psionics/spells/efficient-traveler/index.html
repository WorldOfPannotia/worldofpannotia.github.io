<p><em>They were chuckling at the gnome, for he had picked up much more than it seemed he could easily carry. In fact, there was some doubt as to whether he would be able to move at all. However, with a word and a quick gesture, he trotted right out the door, to the disbelief of the rest of the tavern's patrons.</em></p>

        <p>With this spell, you are able to treat your load as though it weighed only 25% of what it actually weighs. This allows for smaller characters to carry larger amounts of gear, etc. For example, Dalrick has a strength score of 10, giving him a light load of 33 lb. or less. With this spell, a load of 133 lb. or less would be considered light for Dalrick. Essentially, Dalrick's strength score has been increased by +10 for the purpose of determining how much he can carry.</p>
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> This spell does not affect any other aspects of the character's strength, such as ability to use heavy items, weapon attack and damage rolls, strength checks made for any reason, etc. It merely allows a character to carry much more gear than they would be able to otherwise.</p>
