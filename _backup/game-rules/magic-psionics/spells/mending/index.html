        <p><em>Transmutation</em></p>
        <p><strong>Level:</strong> Brd 0, Clr 0, Drd 0, Sor/Wiz 0</p>
        <p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S</p>
        <p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 standard action</p>
        <p><strong>Range:</strong> 10 ft.</p>
        <p><strong>Target:</strong> One object of up to 1 lb.</p>
        <p><strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</p>
        <p><strong>Saving Throw:</strong> Will negates (harmless, object)</p>
        <p><strong>Spell Resistance:</strong> Yes (harmless, object)</p>
        <p>Mending repairs small breaks or tears in objects (but not warps, such as might be caused by a warp wood spell). It will weld broken metallic objects such as a ring, a chain link, a medallion, or a slender dagger, providing but one break exists.</p>
        <p>Ceramic or wooden objects with multiple breaks can be invisibly rejoined to be as strong as new. A hole in a leather sack or a wineskin is completely healed over by mending. The spell can repair a magic item, but the item's magical abilities are not restored. The spell cannot mend broken magic rods, staffs, or wands, nor does it affect creatures (including constructs).</p>
