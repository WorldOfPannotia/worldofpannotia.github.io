        <p><em>Enchantment (Compulsion) [Mind-Affecting]</em></p>
        <p><strong>Level:</strong> Clr 8, Sor/Wiz 8</p>
        <p><strong>Cleric Domains:</strong> Bedlam 8</p>
        <p><strong>Saving Throw:</strong> Will negates</p>
        <p>This spell functions like symbol of death, except that all creatures within the radius of the symbol of insanity instead become permanently insane (as the insanity spell).</p>
        <p>Unlike symbol of death, symbol of insanity has no hit point limit; once triggered, a symbol of insanity simply remains active for 10 minutes per caster level.</p>
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> Magic traps such as symbol of insanity are hard to detect and disable. A rogue (only) can use the Search skill to find a symbol of insanity and Disable Device to thwart it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 33 for symbol of insanity.</p>
        <p><em>Material Component:</em> Mercury and phosphorus, plus powdered diamond and opal with a total value of at least 5,000 gp.</p>
