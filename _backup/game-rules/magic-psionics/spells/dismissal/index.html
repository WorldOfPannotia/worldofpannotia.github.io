        <p>This spell forces an extraplanar creature back to its proper plane if it fails a special Will save (DC = spell's save DC - creature's HD + your caster level). If the spell is successful, the creature is instantly whisked away, but there is a 20% chance of actually sending the subject to a plane other than its own.</p>
