        <p><em>Enchantment (Compulsion) [Language-Dependent, Mind-Affecting]</em></p>
        <p><strong>Level:</strong> Brd 2, Sor/Wiz 3</p>
        <p><strong>Cleric Domains:</strong> Charm 3</p>
        <p><strong>Components:</strong> V, M</p>
        <p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 standard action</p>
        <p><strong>Range:</strong> Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)</p>
        <p><strong>Target:</strong> One living creature</p>
        <p><strong>Duration:</strong> 1 hour/level or until completed</p>
        <p><strong>Saving Throw:</strong> Will negates</p>
        <p><strong>Spell Resistance:</strong> Yes</p>
        <p>You influence the actions of the target creature by suggesting a course of activity (limited to a sentence or two). The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the activity sound reasonable. Asking the creature to do some obviously harmful act automatically negates the effect of the spell.</p>
        <p>The suggested course of activity can continue for the entire duration. If the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the spell ends when the subject finishes what it was asked to do. You can instead specify conditions that will trigger a special activity during the duration. If the condition is not met before the spell duration expires, the activity is not performed.</p>
        <p>A very reasonable suggestion causes the save to be made with a penalty (such as -1 or -2).</p>
        <p><em>Material Component:</em> A snake's tongue and either a bit of honeycomb or a drop of sweet oil.</p>
