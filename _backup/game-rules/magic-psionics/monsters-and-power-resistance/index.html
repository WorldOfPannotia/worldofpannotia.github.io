<p>
    Monsters from the d20 SRD that have Spell Resistance will also have some
    degree of Psionic Resistance, and vice versa. To calculate the amount of
    resistance for the unlisted type, divide the listed resistance by 2 and
    round up. Use this number as the creature's Spell Resistance or Power
    Resistance, as appropriate.
</p>
<p>
    <em>For example, a creature with SR 25 will have PR 13 (25/2 = 12.5;
    rounded up to 13). A creature with PR 40 will have SR 20 (40 / 2 = 20).</em>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Note:</strong> Not all creatures will follow this formula exactly.
    Some will be higher or lower, depending on the particular creature. See a
    monster's individual entry in the <a href="{{ site.url }}/monsters/">monsters</a> section
    for specific information. All creatures will have applicable PR and SR
    specified in their stat blocks.
