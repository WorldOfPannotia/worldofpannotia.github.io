<p>Rings bestow magical powers upon their wearers. Only a rare few have charges. Anyone can use a ring.</p>
<p>A character can only effectively wear two magic rings. A third magic ring doesn't work if the wearer is already wearing two magic rings.</p>
<p><strong>Physical Description:</strong> Rings have no appreciable weight. Although exceptions exist that are crafted from glass or bone, the vast majority of rings are forged from metal &ndash; usually precious metals such as gold, silver, and platinum. A ring has AC 13, 2 hit points, hardness 10, and a break DC of 25.</p>
<p><strong>Activation:</strong> Usually, a ring's ability is activated by a command word (a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity) or it works continually. Some rings have exceptional activation methods, according to their descriptions.</p>
<p><strong>Special Qualities:</strong> Roll d%. A result of 01 indicates the ring is intelligent, 02-31 indicates that something (a design, inscription, or the like) provides a clue to its function, and 32-100 indicates no special qualities. Intelligent items have extra abilities and sometimes extraordinary powers and special purposes. Rings with charges can never be intelligent.</p>

<article id="chameleon-power" class="ogc">
    <p><strong>Chameleon Power:</strong> As a free action, the wearer of this ring can gain the ability to magically blend in with the surroundings. This provides a +10 competence bonus on her Hide checks. As a standard action, she can also command the ring to utilize the spell <em>disguise self</em> as often as she wants.</p>
    <p>Faint illusion; CL 3rd; Forge Ring, <em>disguise self</em>, <em>invisibility</em>; Price 12,700 gp.</p>

    <p><strong>Climbing:</strong> This ring is actually a magic leather cord that ties around a finger. It continually grants the wearer a +5 competence bonus on <em>climb</em> checks.</p>

</article>

<article id="counterspells" class="ogc">
    <p><strong>Counterspells:</strong> This ring might seem to be a <em>ring of spell storing</em> upon first examination. However, while it allows a single spell of 1st through 6th level to be cast into it, that spell cannot be cast out of the ring again. Instead, should that spell ever be cast upon the wearer, the spell is immediately countered, as a counterspell action, requiring no action (or even knowledge) on the wearer's part. Once so used, the spell cast within the ring is gone. A new spell (or the same one as before) may be placed in it again.</p>
    <p>Moderate evocation; CL 11th; Forge Ring, <em>imbue with spell ability</em>; Price 4,000 gp.</p>
</article>

<article id="djinni-calling" class="ogc">
    <p><strong>Djinni Calling:</strong> One of the many rings of fable, this "genie" ring is most useful indeed. It serves as a special <em>gate</em> by means of which a specific djinni can be called from the Elemental Plane of Air. When the ring is rubbed (a standard action), the call goes out, and the djinni appears on the next round. The djinni faithfully obeys and serves the wearer of the ring, but never for more than 1 hour per day. If the djinni of the ring is ever killed, the ring becomes nonmagical and worthless.</p>
    <p>Strong conjuration; CL 17th; Forge Ring, <em>gate</em>; Price 125,000 gp.</p>
</article>

<article id="elemental-command" class="ogc">
    <p><strong>Elemental Command:</strong> All four kinds of <em>elemental command</em> rings are very powerful. Each appears to be nothing more than a lesser magic ring until fully activated (by meeting a special condition, such as single-handedly slaying an elemental of the appropriate type or exposure to a sacred material of the appropriate element), but each has certain other powers as well as the following common properties.</p>
    <p>Elementals of the plane to which the ring is attuned can't attack the wearer, or even approach within 5 feet of him. If the wearer desires, he may forego this protection and instead attempt to <em>charm</em> the elemental (as <em>charm monster</em>, Will DC 17 negates). If the <em>charm</em> attempt fails, however, absolute protection is lost and no further attempt at <em>charming</em> can be made.</p>
    <p>Creatures from the plane to which the ring is attuned who attack the wearer take a -1 penalty on their attack rolls. The ring wearer makes applicable saving throws from the extraplanar creature's attacks with a +2 resistance bonus. He gains a +4 morale bonus on all attack rolls against such creatures. Any weapon he uses bypasses the damage reduction of such creatures, regardless of any qualities the weapon may or may not have.</p>
    <p>The wearer of the ring is able to converse with creatures from the plane to which his ring is attuned. These creatures recognize that he wears the ring. They show a healthy respect for the wearer if alignments are similar. If alignments are opposed, creatures fear the wearer if he is strong. If he is weak, they hate and desire to slay him.</p>
    <p>The possessor of a <em>ring of elemental command</em> takes a saving throw penalty as follows:</p>
    <table id="elem-command-ring-table" class="table table-bordered table-hover">
        <tbody>
            <tr><th>Element</th><th>Saving Throw Penalty</th></tr>

This force strikes a single target, dealing 1d6 points of damage if 1 charge is expended, 2d6 points if 2 charges are used, or 3d6 points if 3 charges (the maximum) are used. Treat this as a ranged attack with a 50-foot maximum range and no penalties for distance.</p>
    <p>The force of the blow is considerable, and those struck by the ring are subject to a bull rush if within 30 feet of the ring-wearer. (The ram has Strength 25 and is Large.) The ram gains a +1 bonus on the bull rush attempt if 2 charges are expended, or +2 if 3 charges are expended.</p>
    <p>In addition to its attack mode, the <em>ring of the ram</em> also has the power to open doors as if it were a character with Strength 25.

(This ability cannot be aided by the Heal skill.) Nonlethal damage heals at a rate of 1 point of damage per level every 5 minutes. If the wearer loses a limb, an organ, or any other body part while wearing this ring, the ring <em>regenerates</em> it as the spell.

        <li><em>Dancing lights</em> (once per hour)</li>
        <li><em>Light</em> (twice per night)</li>
        <li><em>Ball lightning</em> (special, once per night)</li>
        <li><em>Shooting stars</em> (special, three per week)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The first special function, <em>ball lightning</em>, releases one to four balls of lightning (ring wearer's choice). These glowing globes resemble <em>dancing lights</em>, and the ring wearer controls them in the same fashion (see the <em>dancing lights</em> spell description). The spheres have a 120-foot range and a duration of 4 rounds. They can be moved at 120 feet per round. Each sphere is about 3 feet in diameter, and any creature who comes within 5 feet of one causes its charge to dissipate, taking electricity damage in the process according to the number of balls created.</p>

    <p>Once the <em>ball lightning</em> function is activated, the balls can be released at any time before the sun rises. (Multiple balls can be released in the same round.)</p>
    <p>The second special function produces three <em>shooting stars</em> that can be released from the ring each week, simultaneously or one at a time. They impact for 12 points of damage and spread (as a <em>fireball</em>) in a 5-foot-radius sphere for 24 points of fire damage.</p>
    <p>Any creature struck by a <em>shooting star</em> takes full damage from impact plus full fire damage from the spread unless it makes a DC 13 Reflex save. Creatures not struck but within the spread ignore the impact damage and take only half damage from the fire spread on a successful DC 13 Reflex save. Range is 70 feet, at the end of which the <em>shooting star</em> explodes, unless it strikes a creature or object before that. A <em>shooting star</em> always follows a straight line, and any creature in its path must make a save or be hit by the projectile.</p>
    <p>Indoors at night, or underground, the <em>ring of shooting stars</em> has the following properties.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><em>Faerie fire</em> (twice per day)</li>
        <li><em>Spark shower</em> (special, once per day)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The <em>spark shower</em> is a flying cloud of sizzling purple sparks that fan out from the ring for a distance of 20 feet in an arc 10 feet wide. Creatures within this area take 2d8 points of damage each if not wearing metal armor or carrying a metal weapon. Those wearing metal armor and/or carrying a metal weapon take 4d8 points of damage.</p>

<article id="spell-storing-minor" class="ogc">
    <p><strong>Spell Storing, Minor:</strong> A <em>minor ring of spell storing</em> contains up to three levels of spells that the wearer can cast. Each spell has a caster level equal to the minimum level needed to cast that spell. The user need not provide any material components or focus, or pay an XP cost to cast the spell, and there is no arcane spell failure chance for wearing armor (because the ring wearer need not gesture). The activation time for the ring is same as the casting time for the relevant spell, with a minimum of 1 standard action.</p>
    <p>For a randomly generated ring, treat it as a scroll to determine what spells are stored in it. If you roll a spell that would put the ring over the three-level limit, ignore that roll; the ring has no more spells in it. (Not every newly discovered ring need be fully charged.)</p>
    <p>A spellcaster can cast any spells into the ring, so long as the total spell levels do not add up to more than three. Metamagic versions of spells take up storage space equal to their spell level modified by the metamagic feat. A spellcaster can use a scroll to put a spell into the <em>minor ring of spell storing</em>.</p>
    <p>The ring magically imparts to the wearer the names of all spells currently stored within it.</p>
