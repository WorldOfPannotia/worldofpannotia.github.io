<p>Universal items can be configured to do just about anything.</p>
<p>Standard universal items are described below.</p>

<article id="amulet-of-catapsi" class="ogc">
    <p><strong>Amulet of Catapsi:</strong> This copper amulet aids the wearer against other psionic characters. Once per day, the wearer can mentally command the <em>catapsi</em> power, which blankets a 30- foot-radius area surrounding the wearer in telepathic noise for 9 rounds. Each time other psionic characters within this range attempt to manifest a power, they must succeed on a DC 17 Will save or pay 4 more points than they otherwise would for each power manifestation. The limit on the number of power points a subject can spend on a power remains in effect, so the subject may not be able to manifest his or her highest-level powers.</p>

<article id="crawling-tattoos" class="ogc">
    <p><strong>Crawling Tattoos:</strong> Crawling tattoos resemble standard psionic tattoos, but their effects are often harmful rather than beneficial. Like a psionic tattoo, a crawling tattoo can be scribed only with a power of no higher than 3rd level that targets one or more creatures. Exceptions are the <em>body adjustment</em> power, which can be scribed even though it affects only the manifester, and telepathy (compulsion) powers, which cannot be scribed at all. Powers that normally have an area affect only one target if scribed in a crawling tattoo. Powers with an experience point requirement cannot be scribed into a crawling tattoo. Otherwise, crawling tattoos are treated as psionic tattoos until they are activated by the wearer.</p>
    <p>The wearer of a crawling tattoo can tap the tattoo as a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity, mentally specifying a target (to which the wearer must have line of sight). Instead of manifesting its stored power, the tattoo animates, drops to the ground, and scuttles toward the target. The original wearer need no longer concentrate on the tattoo once animated.</p>
    <p>The animated tattoo moves toward its designated target in the same round when it is activated. Treat it as a Fine construct that has AC 18, 10 hit points, a hardness of 5, speed 30 feet, and a bonus on attack rolls equal to the wearer's manifester level + his key ability modifier. Crawling tattoos, unlike true constructs, are subject to illusions, darkness, fog, and similar effects. Should the target be killed, teleport away, or otherwise absent itself before the animated tattoo reaches it, the wearer can reclaim the tattoo. If it is destroyed, a crawling tattoo shatters and evaporates.</p>
    <p>A crawling tattoo must enter the target's square to attack and thus provokes attacks of opportunity as it passes through the target's threatened area. The tattoo makes one touch attack per round thereafter until it strikes its target or is destroyed. On a successful attack, the power scribed in the crawling tattoo affects the target if the target fails the appropriate saving throw; however, powers that normally allow a Reflex saving throw automatically affect the touched target. Crawling tattoos can ferry beneficial powers as well as harmful ones, and a target can allow the tattoo's touch attack to succeed if he or she desires.</p>
    <p>Two examples of crawling tattoos are described below; many more types are possible.</p>
    <p><em>Market Price:</em> The cost of a crawling tattoo depends on the level of the power scribed in it.</p>

<article id="crystal-anchor" class="ogc">
    <p><strong>Crystal Anchor:</strong> A <em>crystal anchor</em> is a shaft of transparent crystal 4 to 5 feet in length, with a sharpened, spearlike head on one end. It ensnares the minds of those within range who manifest powers of a specified psionic discipline. The triggering discipline is specified at the time of creation.</p>
    <p>A <em>crystal anchor</em> is activated by plunging the sharp head into the ground, leaving the shaft freestanding. It projects an invisible, 30-foot-radius field. If a power from the speci- fied discipline is manifested within this range, the manifester must succeed on a Will save (DC 15 + power level) or become subject to an effect similar to <em>brain lock</em>, except that the effect is permanent until dispelled or dismissed by the individual who initially drove the <em>crystal anchor</em> into the earth. Any anchor can be pulled out of the ground and reused at a later time.</p>
    <p>When a <em>crystal anchor</em> successfully ensnares a target, a slender filament of insubstantial ectoplasm connects the victim to the shaft, even one outside the original area of the field.</p>
    <p>A <em>crystal anchor</em> can attempt to ensnare a victim only five times per day. Previously caught targets can remain caught day after day and do not count against this daily limit on attempts.</p>
    <p>An anchor's owner can designate certain creatures to be unaffected by the anchor; such creatures need not make a saving throw and do not count against the daily limit on attempts. One <em>crystal anchor</em> can ensnare multiple targets simultaneously, and multiple <em>crystal anchors</em> can share overlapping fields.</p>
    <p>Anchors that activate when a specific power is manifested in range are also possible, but are rarer.</p>
    <p>A <em>crystal anchor</em> has AC 7, 15 hit points, a hardness of 8, and a break DC of 20.</p>

As a standard action, a psychoactive skin spreads over and covers a Medium or smaller creature that projects the proper command thought; the same command thought causes the skin to shrink back down to its former size. Each of the various psychoactive skins is charged with one of a wide array of powers that constantly affect the wearer.</p>
    <p>A deployed skin completely covers the wearer and all his equipment like a second skin, allowing the wearer to see, hear, and breathe normally. It rolls away from various parts of the body as needed, such as when the wearer needs to eat or access a backpack. Held items or items specifically excluded are not covered by a psychoactive skin.</p>
    <p>Up to three skins can be worn simultaneously, although only the outermost is active in any given round (the powers of hidden skins cannot be manifested). Skin layers can be changed with a command thought as a standard action, which causes a lower-layer skin to come to the surface.</p>
