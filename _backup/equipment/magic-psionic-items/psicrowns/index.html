<p>A psicrown is a special headband that stores several powers. Unlike dorjes, which can contain a wide variety of powers, each psicrown is of a certain kind and holds specific powers. Unless otherwise stated, a psicrown has power points equal to 50 &times; its manifester level when created. These power points can be spent only on the powers that are contained in the psicrown.</p>
<p><strong>Physical Description:</strong> A typical psicrown is large enough to fit on the head of a Medium creature. Some psicrowns are actually crownlike and heavily adorned, while others are simple headbands with crystal centerpieces. All psicrowns weigh less than 1 pound. Most psicrowns are metallic, but one could potentially be composed of any material. Metallic psicrowns have AC 10, 10 hit points, hardness 8, and a break DC of 28. Psicrowns made of psionically reinforced silk have AC 7, 10 hit points, hardness 2, and a break DC of 24. Psicrowns can be made from other, more exotic materials, but all have at least the strength and durability of psicrowns made of psionically reinforced silk.</p>
<p><strong>Activation:</strong> Psicrowns use the power trigger activation method, so manifesting a power from a psicrown is usually a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. (If the power being manifested, however, has a longer manifesting time than 1 standard action, it takes that long to manifest the power from a psicrown.) When activating a psicrown, the user spends power points contained in the psicrown on any one of the psicrown's powers. Powers activated from a psicrown can be augmented with additional power points from the psicrown itself, so long as the total number of power points spent does not exceed the user's manifester level. The user can't manifest a power from a psicrown using his own power points.</p>

<h3 id="psicrown-descriptions">Psicrown Descriptions</h3>
<p>Psicrowns have immense utility because they pack so many capabilities into one item and because they use the wearer's ability score and relevant feats to set the DC for saves against their powers.</p>
<p>Unlike with other sorts of psionic items, the wearer can use his manifester level when activating the power of a psicrown if it's higher than the manifester level of the psicrown.</p>
<p>The minimum manifester level of a psicrown is 8th. The manifester level of a psicrown cannot be more than five levels higher than the minimum manifester level for the highest-level power in the psicrown. Standard psicrowns are described below.</p>
