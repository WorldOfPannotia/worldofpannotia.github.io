<h3 id="descriptions">Epic Rod Descriptions</h3>
<p>Standard epic rods are described below.</p>
<p id="besiegement"><strong>Besiegement:</strong> This rod functions as a <em>+3 light mace</em>. In addition, it is useful for besieging fortifications. Whenever the wielder makes a charge attack, the rod improves to a +6 weapon. Twice per day, the rod can create a battering ram that lasts for 24 rounds. This ram can strike once per round, dealing 20 points of damage with each hit. It cannot be used to target individuals, only fortifications. It can be damaged by normal means (65 hp, AC 22), and <em>disintegrate</em> or <em>dispel magic</em> destroys it. The rod also has the following powers: <em>Siege Engine:</em> One heavy catapult, two light catapults, or three siege towers may be generated with each use of this power. Each weapon created lasts for 12 hours.The power can be used three times per day. Ammunition for 20 shots is included with each weapon created.</p>
<p><em>Transmute Rock to Mud:</em> This power can be used three times per day (caster level 24th, save DC 17).</p>
<p><em>Caster Level:</em> 24th; <em>Prerequisites:</em> Craft Rod, Craft Epic Rod, Craft Magic Arms and Armor, <em>clenched fist</em>, <em>passwall</em>, <em>telepathic bond</em>, <em>transmute rock to mud</em>; <em>Market Price:</em> 447,745 gp; <em>Cost to Create:</em> 224,025 gp + 14,474 XP.</p>
<p id="epic-absorption"><strong>Epic Absorption:</strong> Like a <em>rod of absorption,</em> this rod draws single-target or ray spells and spell-like abilities into itself, nullifying the effect and storing the potential spell levels until the wielder releases the energy in the form of spells of his or her own. Spells of any level (including those boosted beyond 9th level by metamagic) can be absorbed, although epic spells cannot. The rod absorbs a maximum of 150 spell levels and can thereafter only discharge any remaining potential it might have. The rod cannot be recharged.</p>
<p><em>Caster Level:</em> 23rd; <em>Prerequisites:</em> Craft Rod, Craft Epic Rod, Empower Spell, Maximize Spell, empowered maximized <em>spell turning</em>; <em>Market Price:</em> 1,500,000 gp.</p>
<p id="epic-cancellation"><strong>Epic Cancellation:</strong> This rod's touch drains an item of all magical properties, including the magical energy in epic magic items (but not most artifacts). The item touched gets a Will saving throw (DC 26). If a creature is holding the magic item at the time, then the item can use the holder's Will save bonus in place of its own. In such cases, contact is established by making a melee touch attack roll. Upon draining three items, the rod becomes brittle and useless. Drained items can only be restored by <em>wish</em>, <em>miracle,</em> or epic spells specifically designed to restore lost power. A <em>rod of epic cancellation</em> can neutralize a normal <em>sphere of annihilation</em> without itself being cancelled.</p>
<p><em>Caster Level:</em> 25th; <em>Prerequisites:</em> Craft Rod, Craft Epic Rod, <em>dispel magic</em>; <em>Market Price:</em> 330,000 gp.</p>
<p id="epic-might"><strong>Epic Might:</strong> This rod is similar to a <em>rod of lordly might,</em> although it is far more powerful. It is larger than its normal counterpart, and it is constructed of adamantine rather than normal metal. It has six buttons, several spell-like functions, and several mundane uses, and it can also be used as a magic weapon of various sorts.</p>
<p>The following spell-like functions of the rod can each be used once per day.</p>
<ul>
    <li><em>Dominate Person:</em> Touched foe is recipient of a <em>dominate person</em> spell, if the wielder so commands (Will save DC 24). The wielder must choose to use this power and then succeed with a melee touch attack to activate the power. If the attack fails, the effect is lost.</li>
    <li><em>Stun:</em> Upon command, all enemies viewing the rod are stunned, as per the <em>power word stun</em> spell (10-foot maximum range, Will save DC 24). Invoking this power is a standard action.</li>
    <li><em>Damage:</em> Upon command, the rod deals 10d8 points of damage to an opponent on a successful touch attack and cures the wielder of a like amount of damage (Will save DC 26). The wielder must choose to use this power before attacking, as with <em>dominate person</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following weapon uses of the rod have no limits on their use.</p>
<ul>
    <li>In its normal form, the rod can be used as a <em>+6 heavy mace</em>.</li>
    <li>When button 1 is pushed, the rod becomes a <em>+3 longsword of fiery blasting</em>.</li>
    <li>When button 2 is pushed, the rod becomes a <em>+8 battleaxe</em>.</li>
    <li>When button 3 is pushed, the rod becomes a <em>+10 shortspear</em> or <em>+10 longspear</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following mundane uses of the rod also have no limits on their use.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Climbing pole/ladder: When button 4 is pushed, a spike that can anchor in granite is extruded from the ball, while the other end sprouts three sharp hooks. The rod lengthens to anywhere between 5 and 150 feet in a single round, stopping when button 4 is pushed again. Horizontal bars 3 inches long fold out from the sides, 1 foot apart, in staggered progression. The rod is firmly held by the spike and hooks and can bear up to 10,000 pounds. The wielder can retract the pole by pushing button 5.</li>
    <li>The ladder function can be used to force open doors. The wielder plants the rod's base 30 feet or less from the portal to be forced and in line with it, then pushes button 4. The force exerted has a Strength bonus of +24.</li>
    <li>When button 6 is pushed, the rod indicates magnetic north and gives the wielder a knowledge of his or her approximate depth beneath the surface or height above it.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Caster Level:</em> 30th; <em>Prerequisites:</em> Craft Rod, Craft Epic Rod, Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Epic Magic Arms and Armor, <em>cure critical wounds</em>, <em>inflict critical wounds</em>, <em>bull's strength</em>, <em>fireball</em>, <em>dominate person</em>, <em>power word stun</em>; <em>Market Price:</em> 4,293,432 gp; <em>Cost to Create:</em> 2,151,372 gp + 52,841 XP.</p>
<p id="epic-negation"><strong>Epic Negation:</strong> This rod negates the spell or spell-like function or functions of magic items, including epic magic items (but not artifacts). The wielder points the rod at the magic item, and a beam shoots forth to touch the target device, attacking as a ray (a ranged touch attack). The ray negates any currently active item function and has a 75% chance to negate any other spell or spell-like functions of that device, regardless of the level or power of the functions, for 2d4 rounds. To negate instantaneous effects, the rod wielder needs to have readied an action. The target item gets no saving throw or means to resist this effect. The rod can function three times per day.</p>
<p><em>Caster Level:</em> 24th; <em>Prerequisites:</em> Craft Rod, Craft Epic Rod, <em>dispel magic</em>, <em>limited wish</em> or <em>miracle</em>; <em>Market Price:</em> 446,000 gp.</p>
<p id="epic-rulership"><strong>Epic Rulership:</strong> This rod appears to be a royal scepter worth at least 25,000 gp in materials and work-manship alone. The wielder can command the obedience and fealty of creatures within 360 feet when he or she activates the device (a standard action). Creatures totaling 900 Hit Dice can be ruled, but creatures with Intelligence scores of 17 or higher are entitled to a Will saving throw (DC 29) to negate the effect. Ruled creatures obey the wielder as if he or she were their absolute sovereign. Still, if the wielder gives a command that is contrary to the nature of the creatures commanded, the magic is broken. The rod can be used for 1,500 total minutes before crumbling to dust. This duration need not be continuous.</p>
<p><em>Caster Level:</em> 25th; <em>Prerequisites:</em> Craft Rod, Craft Epic Rod, Improved Heighten Spell, improved heightened <em>mass charm</em>; <em>Market Price:</em> 575,000 gp; <em>Cost to Create:</em> 300,000 gp + 15,500 XP.</p>
<p id="epic-spellcaster"><strong>Epic Spellcaster:</strong> This magnificent adamantine rod grants its wielder a +10 insight bonus on Spellcraft checks made to cast epic spells for as long as he or she holds or carries the rod.</p>
<p><em>Caster Level:</em> 21st; <em>Prerequisites:</em> Craft Rod, Craft Epic Rod; <em>Market Price:</em> 245,400 gp.</p>
<p id="epic-splendor"><strong>Epic Splendor:</strong> This rod grants its wielder a +8 enhancement bonus to Charisma for as long as he or she holds or carries the item. Three times per day, the rod creates and garbs him or her in clothing of the finest fabrics, plus adornments of fur and jewels. Apparel created by the rod can remain in existence up to 24 hours. The value of the garb ranges from 70,000 to 100,000 gp (1d4+6 &times;10,000 gp) &ndash; 10,000 gp for the fabric, 50,000 gp for the furs, and the rest for jewel trim (maximum of 40 gems, maximum value 1,000 gp each). In addition, the rod can, once per week, create a palatial mansion in any floor plan the user desires. The mansion is palatial, able to accommodate up to 250 people, housing them in private chambers and serving them fine banquets. The mansion lasts for three days, after which time it, and everything originally in it (including items removed from the mansion), disappear.</p>
<p><em>Caster Level:</em> 21st; <em>Prerequisites:</em> Craft Rod, Craft Epic Rod, <em>fabricate</em>, <em>mage's magnificent mansion</em>; <em>Market Price:</em> 297,400 gp; <em>Cost to Create:</em> 191,200 gp + 12,124 XP.</p>
<p id="excellent-magic"><strong>Excellent Magic:</strong> Once per day when casting a nonepic or epic spell that has an experience point component, the rod supplies up to 2,000 XP, not the caster. If more experience points are required to cast the spell, the caster provides them. As a special use of the rod, the caster can substitute the power inherent in the rod for the experience point development cost of an epic spell. Doing so drains all the power from the rod, rendering it useless.</p>
<p><em>Caster Level:</em> 21st; <em>Prerequisites:</em> Craft Rod, Craft Epic Rod; <em>Market Price:</em> 650,000 gp; <em>Cost to Create:</em> 325,000 gp + 26,000 XP.</p>
<p id="fortification"><strong>Fortification:</strong> This rod functions as a <em>+3 light mace</em>. In addition, it is useful for the construction and defense of fortifications. Whenever the wielder is benefiting from cover, the rod improves that to nine-tenths cover (+10 cover AC bonus and +4 cover Reflex save bonus; failure on the save results in half damage and success results in no damage). Three times per day, the rod can create food and water, as per the cleric spell, for twenty-four people. The rod also has the following powers: <em>Fortify:</em> Four times per day, a stone wall can be created that is 12 inches thick, 10 feet high, and 30 feet long. This wall has a parapet and battlements across the top. (Alternatively, the power can be used to mend a broken existing wall. The gap to be filled can be no more than 300 square feet in area.) In addition, once per day, a great door of iron can be created that is set into one of the newly created walls. This door, 4 inches thick, may be a double door, a drawbridge, or a portcullis, as chosen by the wielder. <em>Siege Engine:</em> One heavy catapult, two light catapults, or three ballistae may be generated with each use of this power. The power can be used four times per day. Ammunition for 20 shots is included with each weapon created.</p>
<p><em>Caster Level:</em> 24th; <em>Prerequisites:</em> Craft Rod, Craft Epic Rod, Craft Magic Arms and Armor, <em>inter-posing hand</em>, <em>create food and water</em>, <em>major creation</em>, <em>wall of iron</em>, <em>wall of stone</em>; <em>Market Price:</em> 465,665 gp; <em>Cost to Create:</em> 231,985 gp + 14,634 XP.</p>
<p id="invulnerability"><strong>Invulnerability:</strong> When held, this rod grants its wielder the following powers.</p>
<ul>
    <li>+5 enhancement bonus to natural armor.</li>
    <li>+5 resistance bonus on saving throws.</li>
    <li>Damage reduction 15/adamantine.</li>
    <li>Immunity to critical hits.</li>
    <li>Spell resistance 32.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Caster Level:</em> 20th; <em>Prerequisites:</em> Craft Rod, Craft Epic Rod, <em>iron body</em>, <em>resistance</em>, <em>spell resistance</em>; <em>Market Price:</em> 600,000 gp.</p>
<p id="nightmares"><strong>Nightmares:</strong> Anyone who comes within 20 feet of the wielder of this rod feels a grave sense of unease. Each person so affected must make a Will save (DC 17) or suffer the effects of a <em>nightmare</em> spell the next time he or she falls asleep. The wielder is immune to this effect. Three times per day, the wielder can utter a command word that causes the rod to emit a horrid, inhuman scream. Up to twenty of the closest creatures within a 30-foot radius who hear this terrible wail believe that their worst nightmares have become reality and suffer the effects of a <em>wail of the banshee</em> spell (DC 23).</p>
<p><em>Caster Level:</em> 21st; <em>Prerequisites:</em> Craft Rod, Craft Epic Rod, <em>nightmare</em>, <em>permanency</em>, <em>wail of the banshee</em>; <em>Market Price:</em> 284,000 gp.</p>
<p id="paradise"><strong>Paradise:</strong> This item creates a nondimensional space, similar in effect to a <em>rod of securit</em>y. However, the rod's possessor and up to 999 other creatures can stay in complete safety for up to 1,000 days divided by the number of creatures affected. Natural healing takes place at five times the normal pace. The rod functions like its nonepic counterpart in all other ways.</p>
<p><em>Caster Level:</em> 24th; <em>Prerequisites:</em> Craft Rod, Craft Epic Rod, Improved Heighten Spell, improved heightened <em>gate</em>; <em>Market Price:</em> 610,000 gp.</p>
<p id="the-path"><strong>The Path:</strong> This rod serves as an aid to trailblazing and travel. It grants the wielder a +30 enhancement bonus on Wilderness Lore checks for tracking and Intuit Direction checks. The handle of the rod is hollow, functioning like a telescope. When the wielder peers through it, the limits of vision are three times normal (and spotting distances for encounters are tripled). In addition, the telescoping handle enables the wielder to view things as though affected by a <em>true seeing</em> spell. The rod also has the following powers. <em>Map:</em> Three times per day a section of the rod unrolls like a scroll from a tube, revealing a map of the surrounding area, centered on the location of the rod. The area shown on the map covers an area as small as 50 feet in radius to as large as 24 miles in radius, zooming in or out with a set of command words. The map reveals natural topography and all types of structures (even hidden ones), but it will not show the location of creatures.</p>
<p><em>Passage:</em> Three times per day, this power allows the wielder and up to five others in a 20-foot radius to move unhindered through natural plant growth or bodies of water (as per the <em>freedom of movement</em> spell).</p>
<p><em>Bridge:</em> Once per day, this power allows the user to create a 5-foot-wide, 40-foot-long stone cause-way across chasms and canyons. The bridge created lasts for 1 hour.</p>
<p><em>Pass without Trace:</em> Once per day, this power can be used on the wielder and twenty others, for 21 minutes. It is otherwise as the spell of the same name (caster level 24th).</p>
<p><em>Caster Level:</em> 21st; <em>Prerequisites:</em> Craft Rod, Craft Epic Rod, <em>find the path</em>, <em>freedom of movement</em>, <em>pass without trace</em>, <em>wall of stone</em>; <em>Market Price:</em> 306,870 gp.</p>
<p id="restless-death"><strong>Restless Death:</strong> The holder of this rod can rebuke or control undead as if he or she were four levels higher. (The rod doesn't grant the ability to rebuke or control undead if the holder doesn't already have it.) In addition, the wielder may speak a command word to cast <em>animate dead</em>. Any skeletons or zombies animated by the rod's power are automatically controlled by the rod, up to the rod's maximum limit of 42 HD, and they follow the orders of the rod's wielder. These undead don't count toward the wielder's limit of controlled undead. Finally, the wielder can speak a second command word to cast <em>slay living</em> (heightened to 10th level; DC 25).</p>
<p><em>Caster Level:</em> 21st; <em>Prerequisites:</em> Craft Rod, Craft Epic Rod, <em>animate dead</em>, <em>control undead</em>, <em>slay living</em>; <em>Market Price:</em> 625,000 gp.</p>
<p id="wyrm"><strong>Wyrm:</strong> Any of the various rods in this series functions as a <em>+5 quarterstaff</em>. Upon casting the rod to the ground (a standard action) and uttering a command word, the rod grows into a specific type of dragon (depending on the specific type of rod) by the end of the round. The dragon created is a wyrm and obeys the commands of the owner. The dragon returns to rod form (a full-round action) whenever the wielder desires, or whenever it moves farther than 500 feet from the owner. If the dragon form is slain, it returns to rod form and cannot be activated again for three days. A <em>wyrm rod</em> only functions if the possessor is of the same alignment as the dragon type.</p>
<p><em>Caster Level:</em> 34th (white or brass), 35th (black or copper), 36th (green or bronze), 37th (blue or silver), 38th (red or gold); <em>Prerequisites:</em> Craft Rod, Craft Epic Rod, Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Epic Magic Arms and Armor, Improved Heighten Spell, improved heightened <em>polymorph,</em> creator must be same alignment as dragon type; <em>Market Price:</em> 1,458,200 gp (brass or white), 1,562,600 gp (black or copper), 1,670,600 gp (bronze or green), 1,782,200 gp (blue or silver), 1,897,400 gp (gold or red); <em>Cost to Create:</em> 729,400 gp + 24,576 XP (brass or white), 781,600 gp + 25,620 XP (black or copper), 835,600 gp + 26,700 XP (bronze or green), 891,400 gp + 27,816 XP (blue or silver), 949,000 gp + 28,968 XP (gold or red).</p>
