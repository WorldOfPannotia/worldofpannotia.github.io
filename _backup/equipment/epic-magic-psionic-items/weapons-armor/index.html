<h3 id="armor">Armor</h3>
Except when otherwise stated, epic magic armor and shields follow the rules for nonepic magic armor and shields.
There is no limit to the enhancement bonus of epic magic armor or shields, to the market price modifier of epic magic armor or shield special abilities, or to the total enhancement bonus and market price modifier of epic magic armor or shields.

<h4 id="armor-shield-base-price">Epic Armor and Shield Base Price</h4>
To find the base price of an epic suit of magic armor or an epic magic shield, roll on Table: Armor and Shields. Note that the +6 to +10 rows apply only to armor and shields that provide an enhancement bonus of +6 to +10 or armor and shields with a single special ability whose market price modifier is +6 to +10. Magic armor and shields with a total effective bonus of +6 to +10 but that have an enhancement bonus of +5 or less and special abilities whose individual market price modifiers are +5 or less use the table for nonepic magic armor to determine price.

<h4 id="armor-shield-ability-descriptions">Epic Armor and Shield Special Ability Descriptions</h4>
Most magic armor and shields only have enhancement bonuses. Such items can also have special abilities, such as those detailed below and nonepic abilities. Armor or a shield with a special ability must have at least a +1 enhancement bonus.
<p id="acid-warding">**Acid Warding:** The armor absorbs the first 50 points of acid damage per round that the wearer would normally take (similar to the _resist energy_ spell).
_Caster Level:_ 21st; _Prerequisites:_ Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Epic Magic Arms and Armor, _protection from energy_; _Market Price:_ +6 bonus.
<p id="cold-warding">**Cold Warding:** The armor absorbs the first 50 points of cold damage per round that the wearer would normally take (similar to the _resist energy_ spell).
_Caster Level:_ 21st; _Prerequisites:_ Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Epic Magic Arms and Armor, _protection from energy_; _Market Price:_ +6 bonus.
<p id="exceptional-arrow-deflection">**Exceptional Arrow Deflection:** This shield functions like a _shield of arrow deflection_ except that it can deflect any type of ranged attack (including spells that require a ranged touch attack) as if it were an arrow. Any time the bearer would normally be struck by a ranged attack, he or she can make a Reflex saving throw (DC 20). If the ranged attack has an enhancement bonus (or a spell level), the DC increases by that amount. If he or she succeeds, the shield deflects the attack. The bearer must be aware of the attack and not flat-footed. Attempting to deflect a ranged attack doesn't count as an action.
_Caster Level:_ 23rd; _Prerequisites:_ Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Epic Magic Arms and Armor, _shield_, _wall of force_; _Market Price:_ +8 bonus.
<p id="fire-warding">**Fire Warding:** The armor absorbs the first 50 points of fire damage per round that the wearer would normally take (similar to the _resist energy_ spell).
_Caster Level:_ 21st; _Prerequisites:_ Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Epic Magic Arms and Armor, _protection from energy_; _Market Price:_ +6 bonus.
<p id="great-invulnerability">**Great Invulnerability:** This suit of armor or shield grants the wearer damage reduction. The damage reduction can be 10/magic, 15/magic, 5/epic, or 10/epic, depending on the armor.
_Caster Level:_ 19th (10/magic), 20th (15/magic), 21st (5/epic), 22nd (10/epic); _Prerequisites:_ Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Epic Magic Arms and Armor, _stoneskin_, _wish_, or _miracle_; _Market Price:_+4 bonus (10/magic),+5 bonus (15/magic),+6 bonus (5/epic),+7 bonus (10/epic).
<p id="great-reflection">**Great Reflection:** Any time its bearer of this shield is targeted with a spell, it automatically reflects the spell back at the caster (as the _spell turning_ spell). The wearer can lower or raise this effect as a free action (thus allowing beneficial spells in as desired).
_Caster Level:_ 25th; _Prerequisites:_ Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Epic Magic Arms and Armor, _spell turning_; _Market Price:_ +10 bonus.
<p id="great-spell-resistance">**Great Spell Resistance:** This suit of armor or shield grants the wearer spell resistance. The spell resistance can be 21, 23, 25, or 27, depending on the armor.
_Caster Level:_ 21st (SR 21), 22nd (SR 23), 23rd (SR 25), 24th (SR 27); _Prerequisites:_ Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Epic Magic Arms and Armor, _spell resistance_; _Market Price:_ +6 bonus (SR 21), +7 bonus (SR 23), +8 bonus (SR 25), +9 bonus (SR 27).
<p id="infinite-arrow-deflection">**Infinite Arrow Deflection:** This shield functions like a _shield of arrow deflection_, though it can deflect any number of projectiles or thrown weapons each round. Any time the bearer would normally be struck by a ranged weapon, he or she can make a Reflex saving throw (DC 20). If the ranged weapon has an enhancement bonus, the DC increases by that amount. If he or she succeeds, the shield deflects the weapon. The bearer must be aware of the attack and not flat-footed. Attempting to deflect a ranged weapon doesn't count as an action. Exceptional ranged weapons, such as boulders hurled by giants or ranged spells, can't be deflected.
_Caster Level:_ 21st; _Prerequisites:_ Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Epic Magic Arms and Armor, _protection from arrows_, _shield_; _Market Price:_ +6 bonus.
<p id="lightning-warding">**Lightning Warding:** The armor absorbs the first 50 points of lightning damage per round that the wearer would normally take (similar to the _resist energy_ spell).
_Caster Level:_ 21st; _Prereq-uisites:_ Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Epic Magic Arms and Armor, _protection from energy_; _Market Price:_ +6 bonus.
<p id="negating">**Negating:** Immediately after the wearer of this armor is hit with a magic weapon, the armor casts _greater dispelling_ on the weapon. (In the case of projectile weapons, the armor casts _greater dispelling_ on the weapon that fired the projectile if it is in range. If it is out of range, the armor does nothing.) No weapon can be affected by the armor more than once per day (regardless of the success of the dispel check).
_Caster Level:_ 20th; _Prerequisites:_ Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Epic Magic Arms and Armor, _greater dispelling_; _Market Price:_ +5 bonus.
<p id="sonic-warding">**Sonic Warding:** The armor absorbs the first 50 points of sonic damage per round that the wearer would normally take (similar to the _resist energy_ spell).
_Caster Level:_ 21st; _Prerequisites:_ Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Epic Magic Arms and Armor, _protection from energy_; _Market Price:_ +6 bonus.

<p id="antimagic-armor">**Antimagic Armor:** This _+1 negating full plate armor of invulnerability_ is crafted of adamantine (and thus has damage reduction 3/-). The armor provides a -5 penalty on dispel checks made against it or its wearer.
_Caster Level:_ 21st; _Prerequisites:_ Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Epic Magic Arms and Armor, _greater dispelling_, _stoneskin_, _wish_ or _miracle_; _Market Price:_ 871,500 gp; _Cost to Create:_ 436,500 gp + 18,700 XP.
<p id="armor-of-the-abyssal-horde">**Armor of the Abyssal Horde:** This_+6 full plate armor's_ clawed gauntlets are effectively +4 keen weapons (1d10/19-20) that afflict the target as if she had been struck by an _energy drain_ spell (Fortitude negates DC 23). The armor bestows two negative levels on any nonevil creature wearing it. These negative levels persist as long as the armor is worn and disappear when the armor is removed. The negative levels never result in actual level loss, but they cannot be overcome in any way (including _restoration_ spells) while the armor is worn.

It has a maximum Dexterity bonus of +10, no armor check penalty, and an arcane spell failure chance of 10%. It is considered light armor, and it allows the wearer to fly at will (as the _fly_ spell). Furthermore, the wearer is at all times surrounded by a _magic circle against evil_ effect (as the spell) which, if dispelled, can be created again as a free action.
_Caster Level:_ 20th; _Prerequisites:_ Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Epic Magic Arms and Armor, creator must be good, _magic circle against evil_; _Market Price:_ 616,300 gp; _Cost to Create:_ 308,300 gp + 16,160 XP.
<p id="bulwark-of-the-great-dragon">**Bulwark of the Great Dragon:** This _+6 heavy shield_ bears the image of a dragon's head. Three times per day, the bearer of the shield can command it to belch forth a breath weapon of the appropriate type. The range of this breath weapon is 80 feet (if a line) or 40 feet (if a cone). Regardless of the type, the breath weapon deals 20d6 points of damage. In addition, the shield provides the bearer with resistance 50 to the energy type that matches its breath weapon.

Except when otherwise stated, epic magic weapons follow the rules for nonepic magic weapons.There is no limit to an epic magic weapon's enhancement bonus, to the market price modifier of an epic magic weapon special ability, or to the total of an epic magic weapon's enhancement bonus and market price modifier.

<h4 id="epic-weapon-base-price">Epic Weapon Base Price</h4>
To find the base price of an epic magic weapon, roll on Table: Weapons. Note that the +6 to +10 rows apply only to weapons that provide an enhancement bonus of +6 to +10 or weapons with a single special ability whose market price modifier is +6 to +10. Magic weapons with a total effective bonus of +6 to +10 but that have an enhancement bonus of +5 or less and special abilities whose individual market price modifiers are +5 or less use the table for nonepic magic weapons to determine price.

<h4 id="weapon-ability-descriptions">Epic Weapon Special Ability Descriptions</h4>
Most magic weapons only have enhancement bonuses. They can also have special abilities, such as those detailed below and nonepic abilities. A weapon with a special ability must have at least a +1 enhancement bonus.
<p id="acidic-blast">**Acidic Blast:** On command, an acidic blast weapon drips acid (though this deals no damage to the wielder). On any hit, this acid splashes the creature struck, dealing +3d6 points of bonus acid damage. On a successful critical hit it instead deals +6d6 points of acid damage (or +9d6 if the critical multiplier is &times;3, or +12d6 if the critical multiplier is &times;4). Bows, crossbows, and slings with this special ability bestow the bonus acid damage upon their ammunition.
_Caster Level:_ 21st; _Prerequisites:_ Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Epic Magic Arms and Armor, _acid fog_; _Market Price:_ +6 bonus.
<p id="anarchic-power">**Anarchic Power:** This weapon is chaos-aligned and thus bypasses the corresponding damage reduction. When a weapon of anarchic power strikes a lawful target, this power deals +3d6 points of bonus chaotic damage to the target, and the target gains one negative level (Fortitude DC 23 to remove 24 hours later). On a successful critical hit it instead deals +6d6 points of chaotic damage and bestows two negative levels (or +9d6 and three negative levels if the critical multiplier is &times;3, or +12d6 and four negative levels if the critical multiplier is &times;4). The weapon bestows three negative levels on any lawful creature attempting to wield it. These negative levels remain as long as the weapon is in hand and disappear when the weapon is no longer wielded. These negative levels never result in actual level loss, but they cannot be overcome in any way (including _restoration_ spells) while the weapon is wielded. Bows, crossbows, and slings with this special ability bestow the anarchic power upon their ammunition. This special ability does not stack with the nonepic anarchic special ability.
_Caster Level:_ 21st; _Prerequisites:_ Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Epic Magic Arms and Armor, _word of chaos_; _Market Price:_ +8 bonus.
<p id="axiomatic-power">**Axiomatic Power:** This weapon is lawful-aligned and thus bypasses the corresponding damager reduction. When a weapon of axiomatic power strikes a chaotic target, this power erupts forth and deals +3d6 points of bonus lawful damage to the target, and the target gains one negative level (Fortitude DC 23 to remove 24 hours later). On a successful critical hit it instead deals +6d6 points of lawful damage and bestows two negative levels (or +9d6 and three negative levels if the critical multiplier is &times;3, or +12d6 and four negative levels if the critical multiplier is &times;4). The weapon bestows three negative levels on any chaotic creature attempting to wield it. These negative levels remain as long as the weapon is in hand and disappear when the weapon is no longer wielded. These negative levels never result in actual level loss, but they cannot be overcome in any way (including _restoration_ spells) while the weapon is wielded. Bows, crossbows, and slings with this special ability bestow the lawful power upon their ammunition. This special ability does not stack with the nonepic axiomatic special ability.
_Caster Level:_ 23rd; _Prerequisites:_ Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Epic Magic Arms and Armor, _dictum_; _Market Price:_ +8 bonus.
<p id="distant-shot">**Distant Shot:** A distant shot weapon can be used against any target within line of sight at no penalty for range.
_Caster Level:_ 21st; _Prerequisites:_ Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Epic Magic Arms and Armor, _discern location_; _Market Price:_ +6 bonus.
<p id="dread">**Dread:** A dread weapon excels at attacking one type of creature. Against its designated foe, its effective enhancement bonus is +4 better than its normal enhancement bonus. Further, it deals +4d6 points of bonus damage against the foe, and if it scores a successful critical hit against the foe, that creature must make a Fortitude save (DC 27) or be destroyed instantly and turned to dust. (This even affects creatures immune to critical hits or death magic.) To randomly determine a dread weapon's designated foe, roll on the following table.
_Caster Level:_ 22nd; _Prerequisites:_ Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Epic Magic Arms and Armor, _summon monster IX_; _Market Price:_ +7 bonus.

{: #asdfasdf .table .table-bordered .table-hover .table-striped data-caption="asdfasdf" }
<p id="everdancing">**Everdancing:** An everdancing weapon is much like a dancing weapon, though it can be loosed with a free action and will fight as long as desired. It can move up to 60 feet away from its owner. Its owner can instruct it to move to a different target as a move-equivalent action. If its owner is rendered unconscious or otherwise unable to direct it, it will fight the same opponent as long as that opponent is conscious and within range. The owner of an everdancing weapon can grasp it again as a free action (assuming it is within reach).
_Caster Level:_ 23rd; _Prerequisites:_ Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Epic Magic Arms and Armor, _animate objects_; _Market Price:_ +8 bonus.
<p id="fiery-blast">**Fiery Blast:** On command, a fiery blast weapon is sheathed in fire (though this deals no damage to the wielder). On any hit, this fire engulfs the creature struck, dealing +3d6 points of bonus fire damage. On a successful critical hit it instead deals +6d6 points of fire damage (or +9d6 if the critical multiplier is &times;3, or +12d6 if the critical multiplier is &times;4). Bows, crossbows, and slings with this special ability bestow the bonus fire damage upon their ammunition.
_Caster Level:_ 21st; _Prerequisites:_ Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Epic Magic Arms and Armor, _fireball_; _Market Price:_ +6 bonus.
<p id="holy-power">**Holy Power:** This weapon is good-aligned and thus bypasses the corresponding damager reduction. When a weapon of holy power strikes an evil target, this power erupts forth and deals +3d6 points of bonus holy (good) damage to the target, and the target gains one negative level (Fortitude DC 23 to remove 24 hours later). On a successful critical hit it instead deals +6d6 points of holy (good) damage and bestows two negative levels (or +9d6 and three negative levels if the critical multiplier is &times;3, or +12d6 and four negative levels if the critical multiplier is &times;4). The weapon bestows three negative levels on any evil creature attempting to wield it. These negative levels remain as long as the weapon is in hand and disappear when the weapon is no longer wielded. These negative levels never result in actual level loss, but they cannot be overcome in any way (including _restoration_ spells) while the weapon is wielded. Bows, crossbows, and slings with this special ability bestow the holy power upon their ammunition. This special ability does not stack with the nonepic holy special ability.
_Caster Level:_ 23rd; _Prerequisites:_ Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Epic Magic Arms and Armor, _holy word_; _Market Price:_ +8 bonus.
<p id="icy-blast">**Icy Blast:** On command, an icy blast weapon is sheathed in icy cold (though this deals no damage to the wielder). On any hit, this cold washes over the creature struck, dealing+3d6 points of bonus cold damage. On a successful critical hit it instead deals +6d6 points of cold damage (or +9d6 if the critical multiplier is &times;3, or +12d6 if the critical multiplier is &times;4).

<p id="lightning-blast">**Lightning Blast:** On command, a lightning blast weapon crackles with electrical energy (though this deals no damage to the wielder). On any hit, lightning coruscates around the creature struck, dealing+3d6 points of bonus electricity damage. On a successful critical hit it instead deals +6d6 points of electricity damage (or +9d6 if the critical multiplier is &times;3, or +12d6 if the critical multiplier is &times;4).

<p id="mighty-disruption">**Mighty Disruption:** Any undead creature struck in combat must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC 21) or be destroyed. A weapon of mighty disruption must be a bludgeoning weapon. (If this property is rolled for a piercing or slashing weapon, reroll.)

<p id="sonic-blast">**Sonic Blast:** On command, a sonic blast weapon emits a low thrumming hum (though this deals no damage to the wielder).

On a successful critical hit it instead deals +6d6 points of sonic damage (or +9d6 if the critical multiplier is &times;3, or +12d6 if the critical multiplier is &times;4).

<p id="triple-throw">**Triple-Throw:** This special ability can only be placed on a weapon that can be thrown. (If this property is rolled for a weapon that cannot be thrown, reroll.) A triple-throw weapon creates two duplicates of itself when thrown. Both the original and the duplicate weapons attack separately (at the same attack bonus). Regardless of the success of any of the attacks, the duplicates immediately disappear after the attack is completed. Any bonuses on damage due to accuracy or precision (including those from sneak attacks, the Precise Shot feat, or the ranger's favored enemy bonus) apply only to the original weapon's damage, not to the duplicates.
_Caster Level:_ 21st; _Prerequisites:_ Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Epic Magic Arms and Armor, _shades_; _Market Price:_ +6 bonus.
<p id="unerring-accuracy">**Unerring Accuracy:** Ranged attacks made with this weapon negate the AC bonus granted by any cover short of total cover.The weapon's ranged attacks also ignore any miss chance from concealment (including total concealment, but the must still aim his or her attacks at the correct square).

<p id="unholy-power">**Unholy Power:** This weapon is evil-aligned and this bypasses the corresponding damage reduction. When a weapon of unholy power strikes a good target, this power erupts forth and deals +3d6 points of bonus unholy (evil) damage to the target, and the target gains one negative level (Fortitude DC 23 to remove 24 hours later). On a successful critical hit it instead deals +6d6 points of unholy (evil) damage and bestows two negative levels (or +9d6 and three negative levels if the critical multiplier is &times;3, or +12d6 and four negative levels if the critical multiplier is &times;4). The weapon bestows three negative levels on any good creature attempting to wield it. These negative levels remain as long as the weapon is in hand and disappear when the weapon is no longer wielded. These negative levels never result in actual level loss, but they cannot be overcome in any way (including _restoration_ spells) while the weapon is wielded. Bows, crossbows, and slings with this special ability bestow the unholy power upon their ammunition. This special ability does not stack with the nonepic unholy special ability.
_Caster Level:_ 23rd; _Prerequisites:_ Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Epic Magic Arms and Armor, _unholy word_; _Market Price:_ +8 bonus.
