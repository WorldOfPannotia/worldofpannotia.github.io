<h3 id="descriptions">Epic Ring Descriptions</h3>
Standard epic rings are described below.
<p id="adamant-law">**Adamant Law:** The wearer of this ring is constantly sheathed in a _shield of law_ effect. It bestows one negative level on any chaotic creature that puts it on. The negative level remains as long as the ring is worn and disappears when the ring is removed. This negative level never results in actual level loss, but it cannot be overcome in any way (including _restoration_ spells) while the ring is worn.
_Caster Level:_ 15th; _Prerequisites:_ Forge Ring, Forge Epic Ring, _shield of law_, creator must be lawful; _Market Price:_ 250,000 gp.
<p id="chaotic-fury">**Chaotic Fury:** The wearer of this ring is constantly sheathed in a _cloak of chaos_ effect. It bestows one negative level on any lawful creature that puts it on. The negative level remains as long as the ring is worn and disappears when the ring is removed. This negative level never results in actual level loss, but it cannot be overcome in any way (including _restoration_ spells) while the ring is worn.
_Caster Level:_ 15th; _Prerequisites:_ Forge Ring, Forge Epic Ring, _cloak of chaos_, creator must be chaotic; _Market Price:_ 250,000 gp.
<p id="energy-immunity">**Energy Immunity:** This band continually provides the wearer with immunity to a single type of energy: fire, cold, electricity, acid, or sonic. The wearer takes no damage from the energy of the specific type.
_Caster Level:_ 20th; _Prerequisites:_ Forge Ring, Forge Epic Ring, _protection from energy_; _Market Price:_ 240,000 gp.
<p id="epic-protection">**Epic Protection:** This ring offers continual magical protection in the form of a deflection bonus to Armor Class of +6 or higher.
_Caster Level:_ 20th: _Prerequisites:_ Forge Ring, Forge Epic Ring, _shield of faith_, creator's caster level must be three times the ring's bonus; _Market Price:_ 720,000 gp (+6), 980,000 gp (+7), 1,280,000 gp (+8), 1,620,000 gp (+9), 2,000,000 gp (+10).
<p id="epic-psionics">**Epic Psionics:** This special crystal ring comes in a variety of types useful only to psionic characters (characters who have power points per day). The wearer's total power points per day are increased, depending on the ring. The points granted are not bonus points &ndash; while the ring is worn, it actually increases the wearer's points per day, but a night's rest is required before gaining access to the increased power point per day total. (Power points are not actually stored in the ring, as would be the case for a crystal capacitor. Instead, the ring grants power points by magnifying the manifester's own power.)
A _ring of epic psionics V_ increases the wearer's daily power points by 43 points, a _ring of epic psionics VI_ grants 63 power points, a _ring of epic psionics VII_ grants 87 power points, a _ring of epic psionics VIII_ grants 115 points, and a _ring of epic psionics IX_ grants 147 power points.
_Manifester Level:_ 23rd (_epic psionics V_), 26th (_epic psionics VI_), 29th (_epic psionics VII_), 32nd (_epic psionics VIII_), 35th (_epic psionics IX_); _Prerequisites:_ Craft Universal Item, Craft Epic Universal Item, _great emulation_; _Market Price:_ 250,000 gp (_epic psionics V_), 360,000 gp (_epic psionics VI_), 490,000 gp (_epic psionics VII_), 640,000 gp (_epic psionics VIII_), 810,000 gp (_epic psionics IX_).
<p id="epic-skill">**Epic Skill:** Rings of this nature continually grant the wearer a +100 competence bonus on checks relating to the skill the ring is tied to. For example, a _Ring of Epic Spellcraft_ would grant a +100 bonus to the _spellcraft_ skill, allowing an epic spellcaster to develop and cast powerful epic spells.
_Caster Level:_ 40th; _Prerequisites:_ Forge Ring, Forge Epic Ring, creator must have 40 ranks in the appropriate skill; _Market Price:_ 1,000,000 gp.
<p id="epic-skill-greater">**Epic Skill, Greater:** Rings of this nature continually grant the wearer a +250 competence bonus on checks relating to the skill the ring is tied to. For example, a _Ring of Epic Spellcraft, Greater_ would grant a +250 bonus to the _spellcraft_ skill, allowing an epic spellcaster to develop and cast powerful epic spells.

Bonus spells from high ability scores, school specialization, or any other source are not doubled.
_Caster Level:_ 23rd (_epic wizardry V_), 26th (_epic wizardry VI_), 29th (_epic wizardry VII_), 32nd (_epic wizardry VIII_), 35th (_epic wizardry IX_); _Prerequisites:_ Forge Ring, Forge Epic Ring, _wish_; _Market Price:_ 250,000 gp (_epic wizardry V_), 360,000 gp (_epic wizardry VI_), 490,000 gp (_epic wizardry VII_), 640,000 gp (_epic wizardry VIII_), 810,000 gp (_epic wizardry IX_).
<p id="ineffable-evil">**Ineffable Evil:** The wearer of this ring is constantly sheathed in an _unholy aura_ effect. It bestows one negative level on any good creature that puts it on.
