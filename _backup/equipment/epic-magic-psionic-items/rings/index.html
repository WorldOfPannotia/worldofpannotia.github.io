<h3 id="descriptions">Epic Ring Descriptions</h3>
<p>Standard epic rings are described below.</p>
<p id="adamant-law"><strong>Adamant Law:</strong> The wearer of this ring is constantly sheathed in a <em>shield of law</em> effect. It bestows one negative level on any chaotic creature that puts it on. The negative level remains as long as the ring is worn and disappears when the ring is removed. This negative level never results in actual level loss, but it cannot be overcome in any way (including <em>restoration</em> spells) while the ring is worn.</p>
<p><em>Caster Level:</em> 15th; <em>Prerequisites:</em> Forge Ring, Forge Epic Ring, <em>shield of law</em>, creator must be lawful; <em>Market Price:</em> 250,000 gp.</p>
<p id="chaotic-fury"><strong>Chaotic Fury:</strong> The wearer of this ring is constantly sheathed in a <em>cloak of chaos</em> effect. It bestows one negative level on any lawful creature that puts it on. The negative level remains as long as the ring is worn and disappears when the ring is removed. This negative level never results in actual level loss, but it cannot be overcome in any way (including <em>restoration</em> spells) while the ring is worn.</p>
<p><em>Caster Level:</em> 15th; <em>Prerequisites:</em> Forge Ring, Forge Epic Ring, <em>cloak of chaos</em>, creator must be chaotic; <em>Market Price:</em> 250,000 gp.</p>
<p id="energy-immunity"><strong>Energy Immunity:</strong> This band continually provides the wearer with immunity to a single type of energy: fire, cold, electricity, acid, or sonic. The wearer takes no damage from the energy of the specific type.</p>
<p><em>Caster Level:</em> 20th; <em>Prerequisites:</em> Forge Ring, Forge Epic Ring, <em>protection from energy</em>; <em>Market Price:</em> 240,000 gp.</p>
<p id="epic-protection"><strong>Epic Protection:</strong> This ring offers continual magical protection in the form of a deflection bonus to Armor Class of +6 or higher.</p>
<p><em>Caster Level:</em> 20th: <em>Prerequisites:</em> Forge Ring, Forge Epic Ring, <em>shield of faith</em>, creator's caster level must be three times the ring's bonus; <em>Market Price:</em> 720,000 gp (+6), 980,000 gp (+7), 1,280,000 gp (+8), 1,620,000 gp (+9), 2,000,000 gp (+10).</p>
<p id="epic-psionics"><strong>Epic Psionics:</strong> This special crystal ring comes in a variety of types useful only to psionic characters (characters who have power points per day). The wearer's total power points per day are increased, depending on the ring. The points granted are not bonus points &ndash; while the ring is worn, it actually increases the wearer's points per day, but a night's rest is required before gaining access to the increased power point per day total. (Power points are not actually stored in the ring, as would be the case for a crystal capacitor. Instead, the ring grants power points by magnifying the manifester's own power.)</p>
<p>A <em>ring of epic psionics V</em> increases the wearer's daily power points by 43 points, a <em>ring of epic psionics VI</em> grants 63 power points, a <em>ring of epic psionics VII</em> grants 87 power points, a <em>ring of epic psionics VIII</em> grants 115 points, and a <em>ring of epic psionics IX</em> grants 147 power points.</p>

<p id="epic-skill"><strong>Epic Skill:</strong> Rings of this nature continually grant the wearer a +100 competence bonus on checks relating to the skill the ring is tied to. For example, a <em>Ring of Epic Spellcraft</em> would grant a +100 bonus to the <em>spellcraft</em> skill, allowing an epic spellcaster to develop and cast powerful epic spells.</p>
