Staffs use the wielder's ability score and relevant feats to set the DC for saves against their spells in such cases where those values would be higher than the listed values for the staffs.

<h3 id="descriptions">Epic Staff Descriptions</h3>
Standard epic staffs are described below.
<p id="cosmos">**Cosmos:** This staff allows use of the following spells.
     * _chain lightning_ (intensified, 1 charge, DC 29)
     * _meteor swarm_ (intensified, 1 charge, DC 34)
     * _sunburst_ (intensified, 1 charge, DC 32)
_Caster Level:_ 27th; _Prerequisites:_ Craft Staff, Craft Epic Staff, Intensify Spell, _chain lightning_, _meteor swarm_, _sunburst_; _Market Price:_ 683,437 gp.
<p id="domination">**Domination:** This staff allows use of the following heightened spells.
     * _dominate monster_ (1 charge, DC 33)
     * _demand_ (1 charge, DC 32)
     * _mass charm monster_ (1 charge, DC 32)
     * _geas_ (heightened, 1 charge, DC 33)
_Caster Level:_ 21st; _Prerequisites:_ Craft Staff, Craft Epic Staff, Heighten Spell, _demand_, _dominate monster_, _geas_, _mass charm monster_; _Market Price:_ 464,400 gp.
<p id="fiery-power">**Fiery Power:** This +_5 flaming quarterstaff_ grants its wielder fire resistance 30 whenever held. In addition, it has the following powers.
     * _wall of fire_ (extended, 1 charge, DC 18)
     * _delayed blast fireball_ (intensified to 240 points of damage, 2 charges, DC 22)
     * _meteor swar_m(heightened to 12th, 2 charges, DC 30)
     * _summon monster IX_ (extended, 2 charges, elder fire elemental only) A _staff of fiery power_ can be broken in a retributive strike. The breaking of the staff must be purposeful and declared by the wielder. All charges currently in the staff are instantly released in a 30-foot- radius globe. All within 10 feet of the broken staff take points of damage equal to eight times the number of charges in the staff, those between 11 feet and 20 feet away take six times the number of charges in damage, and those 21 feet to 30 feet distant take four times the number of charges in damage. Successful Reflex saving throws (DC 17) reduce the damage sustained by half. The character breaking the staff has a 50% chance of traveling to another plane of existence; if he or she does not, the explosive release of spell energy destroys him or her. After all charges are used up from the staff, it remains a +_5 quarterstaff_ with no special abilities. (Once empty of charges, it cannot be broken in a retributive strike.)
