<h3>Weapons</h3>
<h4>Weapon Categories</h4>
<p>Weapons are grouped into several interlocking sets of categories.</p>
<p>These categories pertain to what training is needed to become proficient in a weapon's use (simple, martial, or exotic), the weapon's usefulness either in close combat (melee) or at a distance (ranged, which includes both thrown and projectile weapons), its relative encumbrance (light, one-handed, or two-handed), and its size (Small, Medium, or Large).</p>
<p><strong>Simple, Martial, and Exotic Weapons:</strong> Anybody but a druid, monk, rogue, or wizard is proficient with all simple weapons. Barbarians, fighters, paladins, and rangers are proficient with all simple and all martial weapons. Characters of other classes are proficient with an assortment of mainly simple weapons and possibly also some martial or even exotic weapons. A character who uses a weapon with which he or she is not proficient takes a -4 penalty on attack rolls.</p>
<p><strong>Melee and Ranged Weapons:</strong> Melee weapons are used for making melee attacks, though some of them can be thrown as well. Ranged weapons are thrown weapons or projectile weapons that are not effective in melee.</p>
<p><em>Reach Weapons:</em> Glaives, guisarmes, lances, longspears, ranseurs, spiked chains, and whips are reach weapons. A reach weapon is a melee weapon that allows its wielder to strike at targets that aren't adjacent to him or her. Most reach double the wielder's natural reach, meaning that a typical Small or Medium wielder of such a weapon can attack a creature 10 feet away, but not a creature in an adjacent square. A typical Large character wielding a reach weapon of the appropriate size can attack a creature 15 or 20 feet away, but not adjacent creatures or creatures up to 10 feet away.</p>
<p><em>Double Weapons:</em> Dire flails, dwarven urgroshes, gnome hooked hammers, orc double axes, quarterstaffs, and two-bladed swords are double weapons. A character can fight with both ends of a double weapon as if fighting with two weapons, but he or she incurs all the normal attack penalties associated with two-weapon combat, just as though the character were wielding a one-handed weapon and a light weapon.</p>
<p>The character can also choose to use a double weapon two handed, attacking with only one end of it. A creature wielding a double weapon in one hand can't use it as a double weapon &ndash; only one end of the weapon can be used in any given round.</p>
<p><em>Thrown Weapons:</em> Daggers, clubs, shortspears, spears, darts, javelins, throwing axes, light hammers, tridents, shuriken, and nets are thrown weapons. The wielder applies his or her Strength modifier to damage dealt by thrown weapons (except for splash weapons). It is possible to throw a weapon that isn't designed to be thrown (that is, a melee weapon that doesn't have a numeric entry in the Range Increment column on Table: Weapons), but a character who does so takes a -4 penalty on the attack roll. Throwing a light or one-handed weapon is a standard action, while throwing a two-handed weapon is a full-round action. Regardless of the type of weapon, such an attack scores a threat only on a natural roll of 20 and deals double damage on a critical hit. Such a weapon has a range increment of 10 feet.</p>
<p><em>Projectile Weapons:</em> Light crossbows, slings, heavy crossbows, shortbows, composite shortbows, longbows, composite longbows, hand crossbows, and repeating crossbows are projectile weapons. Most projectile weapons require two hands to use (see specific weapon descriptions). A character gets no Strength bonus on damage rolls with a projectile weapon unless it's a specially built composite shortbow, specially built composite longbow, or sling. If the character has a penalty for low Strength, apply it to damage rolls when he or she uses a bow or a sling.</p>
<p><em>Ammunition:</em> Projectile weapons use ammunition: arrows (for bows), bolts (for crossbows), or sling bullets (for slings). When using a bow, a character can draw ammunition as a free action; crossbows and slings require an action for reloading. Generally speaking, ammunition that hits its target is destroyed or rendered useless, while normal ammunition that misses has a 50% chance of being destroyed or lost.</p>
<p>Although they are thrown weapons, shuriken are treated as ammunition for the purposes of drawing them, crafting masterwork or otherwise special versions of them (see Masterwork Weapons), and what happens to them after they are thrown.</p>
<p><strong>Light, One-Handed, and Two-Handed Melee Weapons:</strong> This designation is a measure of how much effort it takes to wield a weapon in combat. It indicates whether a melee weapon, when wielded by a character of the weapon's size category, is considered a light weapon, a one-handed weapon, or a two-handed weapon.</p>
<p><em>Light:</em> A light weapon is easier to use in one's off hand than a one-handed weapon is, and it can be used while grappling. A light weapon is used in one hand. Add the wielder's Strength bonus (if any) to damage rolls for melee attacks with a light weapon if it's used in the primary hand, or one-half the wielder's Strength bonus if it's used in the off hand. Using two hands to wield a light weapon gives no advantage on damage; the Strength bonus applies as though the weapon were held in the wielder's primary hand only.</p>
<p>An unarmed strike is always considered a light weapon.</p>
<p><em>One-Handed:</em> A one-handed weapon can be used in either the primary hand or the off hand. Add the wielder's Strength bonus to damage rolls for melee attacks with a one-handed weapon if it's used in the primary hand, or &#189; his or her Strength bonus if it's used in the off hand. If a one-handed weapon is wielded with two hands during melee combat, add 1&#189; times the character's Strength bonus to damage rolls.</p>
<p><em>Two-Handed:</em> Two hands are required to use a two-handed melee weapon effectively. Apply 1&#189; times the character's Strength bonus to damage rolls for melee attacks with such a weapon.</p>
<p><strong>Weapon Size:</strong> Every weapon has a size category. This designation indicates the size of the creature for which the weapon was designed.</p>
<p>A weapon's size category isn't the same as its size as an object. Instead, a weapon's size category is keyed to the size of the intended wielder. In general, a light weapon is an object two size categories smaller than the wielder, a one-handed weapon is an object one size category smaller than the wielder, and a two-handed weapon is an object of the same size category as the wielder.</p>
<p><em>Inappropriately Sized Weapons:</em> A creature can't make optimum use of a weapon that isn't properly sized for it. A cumulative -2 penalty applies on attack rolls for each size category of difference between the size of its intended wielder and the size of its actual wielder. If the creature isn't proficient with the weapon a -4 nonproficiency penalty also applies.</p>
<p>The measure of how much effort it takes to use a weapon (whether the weapon is designated as a light, one-handed, or two-handed weapon for a particular wielder) is altered by one step for each size category of difference between the wielder's size and the size of the creature for which the weapon was designed. If a weapon's designation would be changed to something other than light, one-handed, or two-handed by this alteration, the creature can't wield the weapon at all.</p>
<p><strong>Improvised Weapons:</strong> Sometimes objects not crafted to be weapons nonetheless see use in combat. Because such objects are not designed for this use, any creature that uses one in combat is considered to be nonproficient with it and takes a -4 penalty on attack rolls made with that object. To determine the size category and appropriate damage for an improvised weapon, compare its relative size and damage potential to the weapon list to find a reasonable match. An improvised weapon scores a threat on a natural roll of 20 and deals double damage on a critical hit. An improvised thrown weapon has a range increment of 10 feet.</p>

<h4>Weapon Qualities</h4>
<p>Here is the format for weapon entries (given as column headings on Table: Weapons, below).</p>
<p><strong>Cost:</strong> This value is the weapon's cost in gold pieces (gp) or silver pieces (sp). The cost includes miscellaneous gear that goes with the weapon.</p>
<p>This cost is the same for a Small or Medium version of the weapon. A Large version costs twice the listed price.</p>
<p><strong>Damage:</strong> The Damage columns give the damage dealt by the weapon on a successful hit. The column labeled "Dmg (S)" is for Small weapons. The column labeled "Dmg (M)" is for Medium weapons. If two damage ranges are given then the weapon is a double weapon. Use the second damage figure given for the double weapon's extra attack. Table: Tiny and Large Weapon Damage gives weapon damage values for weapons of those sizes.</p>

<p><strong>Critical:</strong> The entry in this column notes how the weapon is used with the rules for critical hits. When your character scores a critical hit, roll the damage two, three, or four times, as indicated by its critical multiplier (using all applicable modifiers on each roll), and add all the results together.</p>
<p><em>xException:</em> Extra damage over and above a weapon's normal damage is not multiplied when you score a critical hit.</p>
<p><em>&times;2:</em> The weapon deals double damage on a critical hit.</p>
<p><em>&times;3:</em> The weapon deals triple damage on a critical hit.</p>
<p><em>&times;3/&times;4:</em> One head of this double weapon deals triple damage on a critical hit. The other head deals quadruple damage on a critical hit.</p>
<p><em>&times;4:</em> The weapon deals quadruple damage on a critical hit.</p>
<p><em>19-20/&times;2:</em> The weapon scores a threat on a natural roll of 19 or 20 (instead of just 20) and deals double damage on a critical hit. (The weapon has a threat range of 19-20.)</p>
<p><em>18-20/&times;2:</em> The weapon scores a threat on a natural roll of 18, 19, or 20 (instead of just 20) and deals double damage on a critical hit. (The weapon has a threat range of 18-20.)</p>
<p><strong>Range Increment:</strong> Any attack at less than this distance is not penalized for range. However, each full range increment imposes a cumulative -2 penalty on the attack roll. A thrown weapon has a maximum range of five range increments. A projectile weapon can shoot out to ten range increments.</p>
<p><strong>Weight:</strong> This column gives the weight of a Medium version of the weapon. Halve this number for Small weapons and double it for Large weapons.</p>
<p><strong>Type:</strong> Weapons are classified according to the type of damage they deal: bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing. Some monsters may be resistant or immune to attacks from certain types of weapons.</p>
<p>Some weapons deal damage of multiple types. If a weapon is of two types, the damage it deals is not half one type and half another; all of it is both types. Therefore, a creature would have to be immune to both types of damage to ignore any of the damage from such a weapon.</p>
<p>In other cases, a weapon can deal either of two types of damage. In a situation when the damage type is significant, the wielder can choose which type of damage to deal with such a weapon.</p>
<p><strong>Special:</strong> Some weapons have special features. See the weapon descriptions for details.</p>

<p>Weapons found on Table: Weapons that have special options for the wielder ("you") are described below. Splash weapons are described under Special Substances and Items.</p>
<p><strong>Arrows:</strong> An arrow used as a melee weapon is treated as a light improvised weapon (-4 penalty on attack rolls) and deals damage as a dagger of its size (critical multiplier &times;2). Arrows come in a leather quiver that holds 20 arrows. An arrow that hits its target is destroyed; one that misses has a 50% chance of being destroyed or lost.</p>
<p><strong>Arrows, Alchemical:</strong> These arrows have relatively normal fletching and shafts, but the head is made of a small glass vial. The vial is designed to break upon impact, and it contains a dose of one of the following items: <a href="#">Acid</a>, <a href="#">Alchemist's Fire</a>, or <a href="#">Holy Water</a>.</p>
<p>Upon a successful hit, the vial breaks and affects the target accordingly. However, the damage for the respective type of substance is reduced to 1d4, and there is no splash damage. The effects are otherwise the same as with the normal substances.</p>
<p>Due to the unusual balance and weight of an alchemical arrow, shooting one incurs a -5 penalty on the attack roll, and the range increment is halved. If the attack misses, roll 1d8 and determine the square that the arrow hit as per the rules on <a href="#">throwing a splash weapon</a>.</p>
<p>The price of an alchemical arrow includes a small dose of the substance in question.</p>
<p><strong>Arrows, Barbed:</strong> Barbed arrows have jagged hooks along the shaft and on the head of the arrow. These hooks point toward the fletching of the arrow. The hooks serve to keep the arrow attached to its target and deal additional damage when the arrow is removed. In order for a creature to safely remove a barbed arrow from themselves, they must succeed on a DC 25 heal check. If someone else performs this task, the check is reduced to DC 20. Removing a single barbed arrow takes a full-round action. If the heal check is unsuccessful, the arrow is still removed from the creature, but they take additional damage equal to the normal damage for the arrow (minus any magical effects such as flaming or frost).</p>
<p>Because barbed arrows do not fly as straight as normal arrows, any creature firing with them takes a -2 penalty to the attack roll. In addition, the arrows have only 75% the normal range increment.</p>
<p><strong>Arrows, Flight:</strong> Flight arrows are thinner, shorter, and have smaller heads than a normal arrow. They are designed to fly farther than standard arrows, though they cause less damage. These arrows increase the range of the arrow by 50%, and the damage is reduced by one die type.</p>
<p><strong>Arrows, Rope Cutting:</strong> Rope cutting arrows are commonly used by individuals who are intending to cause distraction or sabotage. Because ropes are nearly impossible to hit and sever with a normal arrow, these arrows are specially made to cut through. The arrowhead is shaped like a "V", with the inner sides of the head sporting sharp blades. When the arrow is strikes a taut rope or cord, treat the rope's hardness as being half what it normall is. In addition, the arrow deals double damage to the rope. When fired at a normal target (such as in combat), the arrow deals damage of one die type less than normal.</p>
<p><strong>Arrows &amp; Bolts, Signal:</strong> The signal arrow and signal bolt are both created for use by those who stand sentry, typically used by the night watch of cities rich enough to afford the moderately expensive ammunition.</p>
<p>The signal arrow is made entirely out of steel, with a blunt, hollow tip. The tip is made to be filled with oil, and stopped with a piece of flint. The piece of flint, in turn, is attached to a small wire with a hoop or bar on the end. When the arrow is fired, the guard holds on to the wire, so that the flint is pulled free and provides a spark to ignite the oil which sprays out in a fine mist as the arrow travels, causing a burst of fire in the air following the missile's trajectory. In addition, the tip is engineered to emit a high-pitched screech as it flies. The signal arrow is typically shot high into the air to alert others of trouble, and the combination of auditory and visual stimuli is usually enough so that all within several hundred feet know of the disturbance. Properly preparing to fire a signal arrow requires a move action unless you possess the Quick Draw feat, in which case it is a swift action.</p>
<p>A signal bolt is essentially the same as a signal arrow, except engineered to fit in and be fired from a crossbow. In addition, the wire holding the flint stopper is always terminated by a ring, which is attached to a hook on the crossbow. Loading a signal bolt correctly requires a full-round action, or a standard action if you have the Rapid Reload feat. For this reason, guards using a signal bolt typically keep it loaded in the crossbow at all times, as it's extremely cumbersome to load when a situation demands.</p>
<p>Signal arrows and bolts are both reusable, as long as both the flint stopper and arrow/bolt are both recovered. It's a relatively simple matter to refill the head with oil, although care should be taken when inserting the stopper so as not to set it off.</p>
<p>Due to the unusual balance and weight of signal arrows &amp; bolts, they are not suited for normal combat. They deal only subdual damage based on their size, shooting one incurs a -5 penalty on the attack roll, and the range increment is halved. If the attack misses, roll 1d8 and determine the square that the arrow hit as per the rules on <a href="#">throwing a splash weapon</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Axe, Orc Double:</strong> An orc double axe is a double weapon. You can fight with it as if fighting with two weapons, but if you do, you incur all the normal attack penalties associated with fighting with two weapons, just as if you were using a one-handed weapon and a light weapon.</p>
<p>A creature wielding an orc double axe in one hand can't use it as a double weapon &ndash; only one end of the weapon can be used in any given round.</p>
<p><strong>Bolas:</strong> You can use this weapon to make a ranged trip attack against an opponent. You can't be tripped during your own trip attempt when using a set of bolas.</p>
<p><strong>Bolts:</strong> A crossbow bolt used as a melee weapon is treated as a light improvised weapon (-4 penalty on attack rolls) and deals damage as a dagger of its size (crit &times;2). Bolts come in a wooden case that holds 10 bolts (or 5, for a repeating crossbow). A bolt that hits its target is destroyed; one that misses has a 50% chance of being destroyed or lost.</p>
<p><strong>Bullets, Sling:</strong> Bullets come in a leather pouch that holds 10 bullets. A bullet that hits its target is destroyed; one that misses has a 50% chance of being destroyed or lost.</p>
<p><strong>Chain, Spiked:</strong> A spiked chain has reach, so you can strike opponents 10 feet away with it. In addition, unlike most other weapons with reach, it can be used against an adjacent foe.</p>
<p>You can make trip attacks with the chain. If you are tripped during your own trip attempt, you can drop the chain to avoid being tripped.</p>
<p>When using a spiked chain, you get a +2 bonus on opposed attack rolls made to disarm an opponent (including the roll to avoid being disarmed if such an attempt fails).</p>
<p>You can use the Weapon Finesse feat to apply your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier to attack rolls with a spiked chain sized for you, even though it isn't a light weapon for you.</p>
<p><strong>Crossbow, Hand:</strong> You can draw a hand crossbow back by hand. Loading a hand crossbow is a move action that provokes attacks of opportunity.</p>
<p>You can shoot, but not load, a hand crossbow with one hand at no penalty. You can shoot a hand crossbow with each hand, but you take a penalty on attack rolls as if attacking with two light weapons.</p>
<p><strong>Crossbow, Heavy:</strong> You draw a heavy crossbow back by turning a small winch. Loading a heavy crossbow is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity.</p>
<p>Normally, operating a heavy crossbow requires two hands. However, you can shoot, but not load, a heavy crossbow with one hand at a -4 penalty on attack rolls. You can shoot a heavy crossbow with each hand, but you take a penalty on attack rolls as if attacking with two one-handed weapons. This penalty is cumulative with the penalty for one-handed firing.</p>
<p><strong>Crossbow, Light:</strong> You draw a light crossbow back by pulling a lever. Loading a light crossbow is a move action that provokes attacks of opportunity.</p>
<p>Normally, operating a light crossbow requires two hands. However, you can shoot, but not load, a light crossbow with one hand at a -2 penalty on attack rolls. You can shoot a light crossbow with each hand, but you take a penalty on attack rolls as if attacking with two light weapons. This penalty is cumulative with the penalty for one-handed firing.</p>
<p><strong>Crossbow, Repeating:</strong> The repeating crossbow (whether heavy or light) holds 5 crossbow bolts. As long as it holds bolts, you can reload it by pulling the reloading lever (a free action). Loading a new case of 5 bolts is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity.</p>
<p>You can fire a repeating crossbow with one hand or fire a repeating crossbow in each hand in the same manner as you would a normal crossbow of the same size. However, you must fire the weapon with two hands in order to use the reloading lever, and you must use two hands to load a new case of bolts.</p>
<p><strong>Dagger:</strong> You get a +2 bonus on Sleight of Hand checks made to conceal a dagger on your body (see the Sleight of Hand skill).</p>
<p><strong>Flail, Dire:</strong> A dire flail is a double weapon. You can fight with it as if fighting with two weapons, but if you do, you incur all the normal attack penalties associated with fighting with two weapons, just as if you were using a one-handed weapon and a light weapon. A creature wielding a dire flail in one hand can't use it as a double weapon &ndash; only one end of the weapon can be used in any given round.</p>
<p>When using a dire flail, you get a +2 bonus on opposed attack rolls made to disarm an enemy (including the opposed attack roll to avoid being disarmed if such an attempt fails).</p>
<p>You can also use this weapon to make trip attacks. If you are tripped during your own trip attempt, you can drop the dire flail to avoid being tripped.</p>
<p><strong>Flail or Heavy Flail:</strong> With a flail, you get a +2 bonus on opposed attack rolls made to disarm an enemy (including the roll to avoid being disarmed if such an attempt fails).</p>
<p>You can also use this weapon to make trip attacks. If you are tripped during your own trip attempt, you can drop the flail to avoid being tripped.</p>
<p><strong>Fullblade:</strong> A fullblade is nearly two feet longer than a greatsword, and is a great deal heavier. A fullblade cannot be used by characters smaller than those for whom it was made for (i.e. a Medium fullblade cannot be used by a Small character).</p>
<p><strong>Gauntlet:</strong> This metal glove lets you deal lethal damage rather than nonlethal damage with unarmed strikes. A strike with a gauntlet is otherwise considered an unarmed attack. The cost and weight given are for a single gauntlet. Medium and heavy armors (except breastplate) come with gauntlets.</p>
<p><strong>Gauntlet, Spiked:</strong> Your opponent cannot use a disarm action to disarm you of spiked gauntlets. The cost and weight given are for a single gauntlet. An attack with a spiked gauntlet is considered an armed attack.</p>
<p><strong>Glaive:</strong> A glaive has reach. You can strike opponents 10 feet away with it, but you can't use it against an adjacent foe.</p>
<p><strong>Great Boomerang:</strong> The great boomerang is a curved piece of wood approximately seven feet from tip to tip designed specifically for throwing. Because of its size, the great boomerang must be thrown with two hands. At the center of the shaft, several thick bands of leather have been wrapped around the great boomerang, and two handles have been attached.</p>
<p>The boomerang returns at the end of a character's turn during which it is thrown. To catch a returning boomerang, the thrower must be in the square from which the boomerang was thrown, and must have both hands free (holding nothing). The thrower makes an attack roll using the attack bonus used to make the attack against AC 20. If successful, he catches the boomerang. Failure indicates that the great boomerang strikes the character (dealing normal damage) and falls to the ground nearby, using the grenade-like weapons diagram (page 138, PHB) to determine the exact position.</p>
<p>The thrower adds his strength modifier to the damage of a great boomerang, and any character with a strength lower than 18 cannot exert enough force to throw a great boomerang in a lethal attack.</p>
<p>This weapon cannot be used in melee combat.</p>
<p><strong>Guisarme:</strong> A guisarme has reach. You can strike opponents 10 feet away with it, but you can't use it against an adjacent foe.</p>
<p>You can also use it to make trip attacks. If you are tripped during your own trip attempt, you can drop the guisarme to avoid being tripped.</p>
<p><strong>Halberd:</strong> If you use a ready action to set a halberd against a charge, you deal double damage on a successful hit against a charging character.</p>
<p>You can use a halberd to make trip attacks. If you are tripped during your own trip attempt, you can drop the halberd to avoid being tripped.</p>
<p><strong>Hammer, Gnome Hooked:</strong> A gnome hooked hammer is a double weapon. You can fight with it as if fighting with two weapons, but if you do, you incur all the normal attack penalties associated with fighting with two weapons, just as if you were using a one-handed weapon and a light weapon. The hammer's blunt head is a bludgeoning weapon that deals 1d6 points of damage (crit &times;3). Its hook is a piercing weapon that deals 1d4 points of damage (crit &times;4). You can use either head as the primary weapon. The other head is the offhand weapon. A creature wielding a gnome hooked hammer in one hand can't use it as a double weapon &ndash; only one end of the weapon can be used in any given round.</p>
<p>You can use a gnome hooked hammer to make trip attacks. If you are tripped during your own trip attempt, you can drop the gnome hooked hammer to avoid being tripped.</p>
<p>Gnomes treat gnome hooked hammers as martial weapons.</p>
<p><strong>Javelin:</strong> Since it is not designed for melee, you are treated as nonproficient with it and take a -4 penalty on attack rolls if you use a javelin as a melee weapon.</p>
<p><strong>Kama:</strong> The kama is a special monk weapon. This designation gives a monk wielding a kama special options.</p>
<p>You can use a kama to make trip attacks. If you are tripped during your own trip attempt, you can drop the kama to avoid being tripped.</p>
<p><strong>Lance:</strong> A lance deals double damage when used from the back of a charging mount. It has reach, so you can strike opponents 10 feet away with it, but you can't use it against an adjacent foe.</p>
<p>While mounted, you can wield a lance with one hand.</p>
<p><strong>Longbow:</strong> You need at least two hands to use a bow, regardless of its size. A longbow is too unwieldy to use while you are mounted. If you have a penalty for low Strength, apply it to damage rolls when you use a longbow. If you have a bonus for high Strength, you can apply it to damage rolls when you use a composite longbow (see below) but not a regular longbow.</p>
<p><strong>Longbow, Composite:</strong> You need at least two hands to use a bow, regardless of its size. You can use a composite longbow while mounted. All composite bows are made with a particular strength rating (that is, each requires a minimum Strength modifier to use with proficiency). If your Strength bonus is less than the strength rating of the composite bow, you can't effectively use it, so you take a -2 penalty on attacks with it. The default composite longbow requires a Strength modifier of +0 or higher to use with proficiency. A composite longbow can be made with a high strength rating to take advantage of an above-average Strength score; this feature allows you to add your Strength bonus to damage, up to the maximum bonus indicated for the bow. Each point of Strength bonus granted by the bow adds 100 gp to its cost.</p>
<p>For purposes of weapon proficiency and similar feats, a composite longbow is treated as if it were a longbow.</p>
<p><strong>Longbow, Variable Composite:</strong> You need at least two hands to use a bow, regardless of its size. You can use a variable composite longbow while mounted. All variable composite bows are made with a maximum strength rating (that is, each can be set to a range of Strength modifiers as in normal composite bows). If your Strength bonus is less than the current strength rating of the variable composite bow, you can't effectively use it, so you take a -2 penalty on attacks with it. The default variable composite longbow has a maximum Strength modifier of +0. A variable composite longbow can be made with a high maximum strength rating to take advantage of an above-average Strength score; this feature allows you to add your Strength bonus to damage, up to the maximum bonus indicated for the bow. Each point of Strength bonus granted by the bow adds 100 gp to its cost.</p>
<p>To change the strength setting for a variable composite bow, a character must make a DC 15 <em>craft (bowmaking)</em> check. Successfully changing the strength rating of the bow takes 1 minute.</p>
<p>For purposes of weapon proficiency and similar feats, a variable composite longbow is treated as if it were a longbow.</p>
<p><strong>Longspear:</strong> A longspear has reach. You can strike opponents 10 feet away with it, but you can't use it against an adjacent foe. If you use a ready action to set a longspear against a charge, you deal double damage on a successful hit against a charging character.</p>
<p><strong>Net:</strong> A net is used to entangle enemies. When you throw a net, you make a ranged touch attack against your target. A net's maximum range is 10 feet. If you hit, the target is entangled. An entangled creature takes a -2 penalty on attack rolls and a -4 penalty on Dexterity, can move at only half speed, and cannot charge or run. If you control the trailing rope by succeeding on an opposed Strength check while holding it, the entangled creature can move only within the limits that the rope allows. If the entangled creature attempts to cast a spell, it must make a DC 15 Concentration check or be unable to cast the spell.</p>
<p>An entangled creature can escape with a DC 20 Escape Artist check (a full-round action). The net has 5 hit points and can be burst with a DC 25 Strength check (also a full-round action).</p>
<p>A net is useful only against creatures within one size category of you.</p>
<p>A net must be folded to be thrown effectively. The first time you throw your net in a fight, you make a normal ranged touch attack roll. After the net is unfolded, you take a -4 penalty on attack rolls with it. It takes 2 rounds for a proficient user to fold a net and twice that long for a nonproficient one to do so.</p>
<p><strong>Nunchaku:</strong> The nunchaku is a special monk weapon. This designation gives a monk wielding a nunchaku special options. With a nunchaku, you get a +2 bonus on opposed attack rolls made to disarm an enemy (including the roll to avoid being disarmed if such an attempt fails).</p>
<p><strong>Quarterstaff:</strong> A quarterstaff is a double weapon. You can fight with it as if fighting with two weapons, but if you do, you incur all the normal attack penalties associated with fighting with two weapons, just as if you were using a one-handed weapon and a light weapon. A creature wielding a quarterstaff in one hand can't use it as a double weapon &ndash; only one end of the weapon can be used in any given round.</p>
<p>The quarterstaff is a special monk weapon. This designation gives a monk wielding a quarterstaff special options.</p>
<p><strong>Ranseur:</strong> A ranseur has reach. You can strike opponents 10 feet away with it, but you can't use it against an adjacent foe.</p>
<p>With a ranseur, you get a +2 bonus on opposed attack rolls made to disarm an opponent (including the roll to avoid being disarmed if such an attempt fails).</p>
<p><strong>Rapier:</strong> You can use the Weapon Finesse feat to apply your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier to attack rolls with a rapier sized for you, even though it isn't a light weapon for you. You can't wield a rapier in two hands in order to apply 1&#189; times your Strength bonus to damage.</p>
<p><strong>Sai:</strong> With a sai, you get a +4 bonus on opposed attack rolls made to disarm an enemy (including the roll to avoid being disarmed if such an attempt fails).</p>
<p>The sai is a special monk weapon. This designation gives a monk wielding a sai special options.</p>
<p><strong>Scythe:</strong> A scythe can be used to make trip attacks. If you are tripped during your own trip attempt, you can drop the scythe to avoid being tripped.</p>
<p><strong>Shield, Heavy or Light:</strong> You can bash with a shield instead of using it for defense. See Armor for details.</p>
<p><strong>Shortbow:</strong> You need at least two hands to use a bow, regardless of its size. You can use a shortbow while mounted. If you have a penalty for low Strength, apply it to damage rolls when you use a shortbow. If you have a bonus for high Strength, you can apply it to damage rolls when you use a composite shortbow (see below) but not a regular shortbow.</p>
<p><strong>Shortbow, Composite:</strong> You need at least two hands to use a bow, regardless of its size. You can use a composite shortbow while mounted. All composite bows are made with a particular strength rating (that is, each requires a minimum Strength modifier to use with proficiency). If your Strength bonus is lower than the strength rating of the composite bow, you can't effectively use it, so you take a -2 penalty on attacks with it. The default composite shortbow requires a Strength modifier of +0 or higher to use with proficiency. A composite shortbow can be made with a high strength rating to take advantage of an above-average Strength score; this feature allows you to add your Strength bonus to damage, up to the maximum bonus indicated for the bow. Each point of Strength bonus granted by the bow adds 75 gp to its cost.</p>
<p>For purposes of weapon proficiency and similar feats, a composite shortbow is treated as if it were a shortbow.</p>
<p><strong>Shortbow, Variable Composite:</strong> You need at least two hands to use a bow, regardless of its size. You can use a variable composite shortbow while mounted. All variable composite bows are made with a maximum strength rating (that is, each can be set to a range of Strength modifiers as in normal composite bows). If your Strength bonus is less than the current strength rating of the variable composite bow, you can't effectively use it, so you take a -2 penalty on attacks with it. The default variable composite shortbow has a maximum Strength modifier of +0. A variable composite shortbow can be made with a high maximum strength rating to take advantage of an above-average Strength score; this feature allows you to add your Strength bonus to damage, up to the maximum bonus indicated for the bow. Each point of Strength bonus granted by the bow adds 100 gp to its cost.</p>
<p>To change the strength setting for a variable composite bow, a character must make a DC 15 <em>craft (bowmaking)</em> check. Successfully changing the strength rating of the bow takes 1 minute.</p>
<p>For purposes of weapon proficiency and similar feats, a variable composite shortbow is treated as if it were a shortbow.</p>
<p><strong>Shortspear:</strong> A shortspear is small enough to wield one-handed. It may also be thrown.</p>
<p><strong>Shuriken:</strong> A shuriken is a special monk weapon. This designation gives a monk wielding shuriken special options. A shuriken can't be used as a melee weapon.</p>
<p>Although they are thrown weapons, shuriken are treated as ammunition for the purposes of drawing them, crafting masterwork or otherwise special versions of them and what happens to them after they are thrown.</p>
<p><strong>Siangham:</strong> The siangham is a special monk weapon. This designation gives a monk wielding a siangham special options.</p>
<p><strong>Sickle:</strong> A sickle can be used to make trip attacks. If you are tripped during your own trip attempt, you can drop the sickle to avoid being tripped.</p>
<p><strong>Sling:</strong> Your Strength modifier applies to damage rolls when you use a sling, just as it does for thrown weapons. You can fire, but not load, a sling with one hand. Loading a sling is a move action that requires two hands and provokes attacks of opportunity.</p>
<p>You can hurl ordinary stones with a sling, but stones are not as dense or as round as bullets. Thus, such an attack deals damage as if the weapon were designed for a creature one size category smaller than you and you take a -1 penalty on attack rolls.</p>
<p><strong>Spear:</strong> A spear can be thrown. If you use a ready action to set a spear against a charge, you deal double damage on a successful hit against a charging character.</p>
<p><strong>Spiked Armor:</strong> You can outfit your armor with spikes, which can deal damage in a grapple or as a separate attack. See Armor for details.</p>
<p><strong>Spiked Shield, Heavy or Light:</strong> You can bash with a spiked shield instead of using it for defense. See Armor for details.</p>
<p><strong>Strike, Unarmed:</strong> A Medium character deals 1d3 points of nonlethal damage with an unarmed strike. A Small character deals 1d2 points of nonlethal damage. A monk or any character with the Improved Unarmed Strike feat can deal lethal or nonlethal damage with unarmed strikes, at her option. The damage from an unarmed strike is considered weapon damage for the purposes of effects that give you a bonus on weapon damage rolls.</p>
<p>An unarmed strike is always considered a light weapon. Therefore, you can use the Weapon Finesse feat to apply your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier to attack rolls with an unarmed strike.</p>
<p><strong>Sword, Bastard:</strong> A bastard sword is too large to use in one hand without special training; thus, it is an exotic weapon. A character can use a bastard sword two-handed as a martial weapon.</p>
<p><strong>Sword, Two-Bladed:</strong> A two-bladed sword is a double weapon. You can fight with it as if fighting with two weapons, but if you do, you incur all the normal attack penalties associated with fighting with two weapons, just as if you were using a one-handed weapon and a light weapon. A creature wielding a two-bladed sword in one hand can't use it as a double weapon &ndash; only one end of the weapon can be used in any given round.</p>
<p><strong>Trident:</strong> This weapon can be thrown. If you use a ready action to set a trident against a charge, you deal double damage on a successful hit against a charging character.</p>
<p><strong>Urgrosh, Dwarven:</strong> A dwarven urgrosh is a double weapon. You can fight with it as if fighting with two weapons, but if you do, you incur all the normal attack penalties associated with fighting with two weapons, just as if you were using a one-handed weapon and a light weapon. The urgrosh's axe head is a slashing weapon that deals 1d8 points of damage. Its spear head is a piercing weapon that deals 1d6 points of damage. You can use either head as the primary weapon. The other is the off-hand weapon. A creature wielding a dwarven urgrosh in one hand can't use it as a double weapon &ndash; only one end of the weapon can be used in any given round.</p>
<p>If you use a ready action to set an urgrosh against a charge, you deal double damage if you score a hit against a charging character. If you use an urgrosh against a charging character, the spear head is the part of the weapon that deals damage.</p>
<p>Dwarves treat dwarven urgroshes as martial weapons.</p>
<p><strong>Waraxe, Dwarven:</strong> A dwarven waraxe is too large to use in one hand without special training; thus, it is an exotic weapon. A Medium character can use a dwarven waraxe two-handed as a martial weapon, or a Large creature can use it one-handed in the same way. A dwarf treats a dwarven waraxe as a martial weapon even when using it in one hand.</p>
<p><strong>Whip:</strong> A whip deals nonlethal damage. It deals no damage to any creature with an armor bonus of +1 or higher or a natural armor bonus of +3 or higher. The whip is treated as a melee weapon with 15-foot reach, though you don't threaten the area into which you can make an attack. In addition, unlike most other weapons with reach, you can use it against foes anywhere within your reach (including adjacent foes).</p>
<p>Using a whip provokes an attack of opportunity, just as if you had used a ranged weapon.</p>
<p>You can make trip attacks with a whip. If you are tripped during your own trip attempt, you can drop the whip to avoid being tripped.</p>
<p>When using a whip, you get a +2 bonus on opposed attack rolls made to disarm an opponent (including the roll to keep from being disarmed if the attack fails).</p>
<p>You can use the Weapon Finesse feat to apply your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier to attack rolls with a whip sized for you, even though it isn't a light weapon for you.</p>

<h4>Masterwork Weapons</h4>
<p>A masterwork weapon is a finely crafted version of a normal weapon. Wielding it provides a +1 enhancement bonus on attack rolls.</p>
<p>You can't add the masterwork quality to a weapon after it is created; it must be crafted as a masterwork weapon (see the Craft skill). The masterwork quality adds 300 gp to the cost of a normal weapon (or 6 gp to the cost of a single unit of ammunition). Adding the masterwork quality to a double weapon costs twice the normal increase (+600 gp).</p>
<p>Masterwork ammunition is damaged (effectively destroyed) when used. The enhancement bonus of masterwork ammunition does not stack with any enhancement bonus of the projectile weapon firing it.</p>
<p>All magic weapons are automatically considered to be of masterwork quality. The enhancement bonus granted by the masterwork quality doesn't stack with the enhancement bonus provided by the weapon's magic.</p>
<p>Even though some types of armor and shields can be used as weapons, you can't create a masterwork version of such an item that confers an enhancement bonus on attack rolls. Instead, masterwork armor and shields have lessened armor check penalties.</p>

<h3>Armor</h3>
<h4>Armor Qualities</h4>
<p>To wear heavier armor effectively, a character can select the Armor Proficiency feats, but most classes are automatically proficient with the armors that work best for them.</p>
<p>Armor and shields can take damage from some types of attacks.</p>
<p>Here is the format for armor entries (given as column headings on Table: Armor and Shields, below).</p>
<p><strong>Cost:</strong> The cost of the armor for Small or Medium humanoid creatures. See Armor for Unusual Creatures, below, for armor prices for other creatures.</p>
<p><strong>Armor/Shield Bonus:</strong> Each armor grants an armor bonus to AC, while shields grant a shield bonus to AC. The armor bonus from a suit of armor doesn't stack with other effects or items that grant an armor bonus. Similarly, the shield bonus from a shield doesn't stack with other effects that grant a shield bonus.</p>
<p><strong>Maximum Dex Bonus:</strong> This number is the maximum Dexterity bonus to AC that this type of armor allows. Heavier armors limit mobility, reducing the wearer's ability to dodge blows. This restriction doesn't affect any other Dexterity-related abilities.</p>
<p>Even if a character's Dexterity bonus to AC drops to 0 because of armor, this situation does not count as losing a Dexterity bonus to AC.</p>
<p>Your character's encumbrance (the amount of gear he or she carries) may also restrict the maximum Dexterity bonus that can be applied to his or her Armor Class.</p>
<p><em>Shields:</em> Shields do not affect a character's maximum Dexterity bonus.</p>
<p><strong>Armor Check Penalty:</strong> Any armor heavier than leather hurts a character's ability to use some skills. An armor check penalty number is the penalty that applies to Balance, Climb, Escape Artist, Hide, Jump, Move Silently, Sleight of Hand, and Tumble checks by a character wearing a certain kind of armor. Double the normal armor check penalty is applied to Swim checks. A character's encumbrance (the amount of gear carried, including armor) may also apply an armor check penalty.</p>
<p><em>Shields:</em> If a character is wearing armor and using a shield, both armor check penalties apply.</p>
<p><em>Nonproficient with Armor Worn:</em> A character who wears armor and/or uses a shield with which he or she is not proficient takes the armor's (and/or shield's) armor check penalty on attack rolls and on all Strength-based and Dexterity-based ability and skill checks. The penalty for nonproficiency with armor stacks with the penalty for nonproficiency with shields.</p>
<p><em>Sleeping in Armor:</em> A character who sleeps in medium or heavy armor is automatically fatigued the next day. He or she takes a -2 penalty on Strength and Dexterity and can't charge or run. Sleeping in light armor does not cause fatigue.</p>
<p><strong>Arcane Spell Failure:</strong> Armor interferes with the gestures that a spellcaster must make to cast an arcane spell that has a somatic component. Arcane spellcasters face the possibility of arcane spell failure if they're wearing armor. Bards can wear light armor without incurring any arcane spell failure chance for their bard spells.</p>
<p><em>Casting an Arcane Spell in Armor:</em> A character who casts an arcane spell while wearing armor must usually make an arcane spell failure roll. The number in the Arcane Spell Failure Chance column on Table: Armor and Shields is the chance that the spell fails and is ruined. If the spell lacks a somatic component, however, it can be cast with no chance of arcane spell failure.</p>
<p><em>Shields:</em> If a character is wearing armor and using a shield, add the two numbers together to get a single arcane spell failure chance.</p>
<p><strong>Speed:</strong> Medium or heavy armor slows the wearer down. The number on Table: Armor and Shields is the character's speed while wearing the armor. Humans, elves, half-elves, and half-orcs have an unencumbered speed of 30 feet.</p>
<p>They use the first column. Dwarves, gnomes, and halflings have an unencumbered speed of 20 feet. They use the second column. Remember, however, that a dwarf 's land speed remains 20 feet even in medium or heavy armor or when carrying a medium or heavy load.</p>
<p><em>Shields:</em> Shields do not affect a character's speed.</p>
<p><strong>Weight:</strong> This column gives the weight of the armor sized for a Medium wearer. Armor fitted for Small characters weighs half as much, and armor for Large characters weighs twice as much.</p>

<h4>Armor Descriptions</h4>
<p>Any special benefits or accessories to the types of armor found on Table: Armor and Shields are described below.</p>
<p><strong>Armor Spikes:</strong> You can have spikes added to your armor, which allow you to deal extra piercing damage (see Table: Weapons) on a successful grapple attack. The spikes count as a martial weapon. If you are not proficient with them, you take a -4 penalty on grapple checks when you try to use them. You can also make a regular melee attack (or off-hand attack) with the spikes, and they count as a light weapon in this case. (You can't also make an attack with armor spikes if you have already made an attack with another off-hand weapon, and vice versa.)</p>
<p>An enhancement bonus to a suit of armor does not improve the spikes' effectiveness, but the spikes can be made into magic weapons in their own right.</p>
<p><strong>Banded Mail:</strong> The suit includes gauntlets.</p>
<p><strong>Breastplate:</strong> It comes with a helmet and greaves.</p>
<p><strong>Buckler:</strong> This small metal shield is worn strapped to your forearm. You can use a bow or crossbow without penalty while carrying it. You can also use your shield arm to wield a weapon (whether you are using an off-hand weapon or using your off hand to help wield a two-handed weapon), but you take a -1 penalty on attack rolls while doing so. This penalty stacks with those that may apply for fighting with your off hand and for fighting with two weapons. In any case, if you use a weapon in your off hand, you don't get the buckler's AC bonus for the rest of the round.</p>
<p>You can't bash someone with a buckler.</p>
<p><strong>Chain Shirt:</strong> A chain shirt comes with a steel cap.</p>
<p><strong>Chainmail:</strong> The suit includes gauntlets.</p>
<p><strong>Full Plate:</strong> The suit includes gauntlets, heavy leather boots, a visored helmet, and a thick layer of padding that is worn underneath the armor. Each suit of full plate must be individually fitted to its owner by a master armorsmith, although a captured suit can be resized to fit a new owner at a cost of 200 to 800 (2d4x100) gold pieces.</p>
<p><strong>Gauntlet, Locked:</strong> This armored gauntlet has small chains and braces that allow the wearer to attach a weapon to the gauntlet so that it cannot be dropped easily. It provides a +10 bonus on any roll made to keep from being disarmed in combat. Removing a weapon from a locked gauntlet or attaching a weapon to a locked gauntlet is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity.</p>
<p>The price given is for a single locked gauntlet. The weight given applies only if you're wearing a breastplate, light armor, or no armor. Otherwise, the locked gauntlet replaces a gauntlet you already have as part of the armor.</p>
<p>While the gauntlet is locked, you can't use the hand wearing it for casting spells or employing skills. (You can still cast spells with somatic components, provided that your other hand is free.)</p>
<p>Like a normal gauntlet, a locked gauntlet lets you deal lethal damage rather than nonlethal damage with an unarmed strike.</p>
<p><strong>Half-Plate:</strong> The suit includes gauntlets.</p>
<p><strong>Mages' Robes:</strong> Adventuring mages are all too rarely well armored, and often have to rely on the tougher party members to keep them safe of dangerous traps, monsters and anything else that might be out there. It's no surprise - few mages, with their limited spell selection, will specialize in defensive spells, and fewer still are willing to wear armor and risk a chance of spell failure. Mages' robes is a solution to this problem.</p>
<p>Mages' robes are designed specifically with freedom of movement in mind, and are always masterwork. While they provide no armor bonus, they can be enchanted just as regular armor can.</p>
<p><strong>Scale Mail:</strong> The suit includes gauntlets.</p>
<p><strong>Shield, Heavy, Wooden or Steel:</strong> You strap a shield to your forearm and grip it with your hand. A heavy shield is so heavy that you can't use your shield hand for anything else.</p>
<p><em>Wooden or Steel:</em> Wooden and steel shields offer the same basic protection, though they respond differently to special attacks.</p>
<p><em>Shield Bash Attacks:</em> You can bash an opponent with a heavy shield, using it as an off-hand weapon. See Table: Weapons for the damage dealt by a shield bash. Used this way, a heavy shield is a martial bludgeoning weapon. For the purpose of penalties on attack rolls, treat a heavy shield as a one-handed weapon. If you use your shield as a weapon, you lose its AC bonus until your next action (usually until the next round). An enhancement bonus on a shield does not improve the effectiveness of a shield bash made with it, but the shield can be made into a magic weapon in its own right.</p>
<p><strong>Shield, Light, Wooden or Steel:</strong> You strap a shield to your forearm and grip it with your hand. A light shield's weight lets you carry other items in that hand, although you cannot use weapons with it.</p>
<p><em>Wooden or Steel:</em> Wooden and steel shields offer the same basic protection, though they respond differently to special attacks.</p>
<p><em>Shield Bash Attacks:</em> You can bash an opponent with a light shield, using it as an off-hand weapon. See Table: Weapons for the damage dealt by a shield bash. Used this way, a light shield is a martial bludgeoning weapon. For the purpose of penalties on attack rolls, treat a light shield as a light weapon. If you use your shield as a weapon, you lose its AC bonus until your next action (usually until the next round). An enhancement bonus on a shield does not improve the effectiveness of a shield bash made with it, but the shield can be made into a magic weapon in its own right.</p>
<p><strong>Shield, Tower:</strong> This massive wooden shield is nearly as tall as you are. In most situations, it provides the indicated shield bonus to your AC. However, you can instead use it as total cover, though you must give up your attacks to do so. The shield does not, however, provide cover against targeted spells; a spellcaster can cast a spell on you by targeting the shield you are holding. You cannot bash with a tower shield, nor can you use your shield hand for anything else.</p>
<p>When employing a tower shield in combat, you take a -2 penalty on attack rolls because of the shield's encumbrance.</p>
<p><strong>Shield Spikes:</strong> When added to your shield, these spikes turn it into a martial piercing weapon that increases the damage dealt by a shield bash as if the shield were designed for a creature one size category larger than you. You can't put spikes on a buckler or a tower shield. Otherwise, attacking with a spiked shield is like making a shield bash attack (see above).</p>
<p>An enhancement bonus on a spiked shield does not improve the effectiveness of a shield bash made with it, but a spiked shield can be made into a magic weapon in its own right.</p>
<p><strong>Splint Mail:</strong> The suit includes gauntlets.</p>

<h4>Masterwork Armor</h4>
<p>Just as with weapons, you can purchase or craft masterwork versions of armor or shields. Such a well-made item functions like the normal version, except that its armor check penalty is lessened by 1.</p>
<p>A masterwork suit of armor or shield costs an extra 150 gp over and above the normal cost for that type of armor or shield.</p>
<p>The masterwork quality of a suit of armor or shield never provides a bonus on attack or damage rolls, even if the armor or shield is used as a weapon.</p>
<p>All magic armors and shields are automatically considered to be of masterwork quality.</p>
<p>You can't add the masterwork quality to armor or a shield after it is created; it must be crafted as a masterwork item.</p>

<h4>Armor for Unusual Creatures</h4>
<p>Armor and shields for unusually big creatures, unusually little creatures, and nonhumanoid creatures have different costs and weights from those given on Table: Armor and Shields. Refer to the appropriate line on the table below and apply the multipliers to cost and weight for the armor type in question.</p>

<h4>Getting Into and Out of Armor</h4>
<p>The time required to don armor depends on its type; see Table: Donning Armor.</p>
<p><strong>Don:</strong> This column tells how long it takes a character to put the armor on. (One minute is 10 rounds.) Readying (strapping on) a shield is only a move action.</p>
<p><strong>Don Hastily:</strong> This column tells how long it takes to put the armor on in a hurry. The armor check penalty and armor bonus for hastily donned armor are each 1 point worse than normal.</p>
<p><strong>Remove:</strong> This column tells how long it takes to get the armor off. Loosing a shield (removing it from the arm and dropping it) is only a move action.</p>
